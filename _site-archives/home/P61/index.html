				  <p>Gaga Knuckle<br />
[ ɡɑːɡɑː nuhk-uhl]<br />
–noun<br />
1. Colloquial term referring to surface bleeding from the joint of a finger.&nbsp; Often caused by scraping one&#8217;s hand against an astroturf or carpeted court in order to hit a volleyball/handball/slight deflated soccer ball against an opponents knees. Though not fatal, such an injury can be very uncomfortable  as you play for hours on end. Common cures include using a flat handed technique as opposed to a fist, or seeing a camp nurse.
