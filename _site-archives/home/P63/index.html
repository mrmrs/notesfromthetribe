			<p>
				  <p>My Father was a Shofar.<br />
He was born from the crude horn of a ram.<br />
Then softened, flattened, and polished into a beautiful instrument that was complex to play yet obtusely simple in it&#8217;s construction.<br />
An object equally spiritual and utilitarian.<br />
Though often silent, when called upon his sonic force brought down the walls of Jericho, signaled the New Year, and made the monsters under my bed go away.<br />
They were long deep sounds without melody whose notes still resonate long after they&#8217;ve been played.
