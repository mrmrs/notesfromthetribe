				  <p>If the Torah were a woman, I wouldn&#8217;t date her.<br />

Granted, she&#8217;d probably be a beautiful 5&#8217;5&#8217;&#8217; brunette with kind eyes and body for days, but the simple fact of the matter is this: It&#8217;s not her; it&#8217;s me.<br />

For one, I&#8217;d have a problem with the age difference— I&#8217;m 26 and she&#8217;s at least 3313 years old. While she might have some experience under her belt, the fact that I&#8217;d constantly have to update her on references to “The Office,” what a Justin Bieber is and things like the Internet, might get tired very quickly.&nbsp; Then there&#8217;s my neediness. If I&#8217;m with someone I care about, I need to be able to see them more than just the holidays, three mornings and one afternoon a week. On the rare occasion that I saw her, she&#8217;d expect me to dress her up in velvet, with little tassels and lots of jewelry, and parade her around in public while everyone kissed her.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a jealous guy who likes to stay in.&nbsp; When undressed, I would be forbidden from touching her, and would only be permitted to do so with a small metal rod shaped like an index finger.&nbsp;  Not to mention that everyone would be watching me do it. And, of course, no matter how much I argued my point of view or tried to understand exactly what she meant, I would always be wrong, and she, as the word of G-d, would be right. Any one of these reasons is more than enough to break the deal for me.<br />

It&#8217;s a good thing the Torah is a holy scripture and not a woman, otherwise I&#8217;d have a real hard time being a Jew.
