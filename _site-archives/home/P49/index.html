				  <p>I&#8217;m fairly confident I could successfully guide King David&#8217;s music career.</p>

<p>Now, I know what you&#8217;re thinking. In today&#8217;s synthesized, super-sexualized, overhyped music industry is there really a place for spiritual harp music? </p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p>The key is volume. The entire Beatles catalogue has 275 original compositions. <br />
David wrote 3600.&nbsp; The man is a machine.&nbsp; The licensing alone would be more than enough.&nbsp; He&#8217;s also got a niche with religious music.&nbsp; Oh yeah and I forgot to mention his biggest fan….God.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m thinking we market him as &#8216;Kenny G meets John Mayer….with a harp.&#8217;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve even got a name for his first album: &#8216;Yaweh or the Highway&#8217;.</p>
