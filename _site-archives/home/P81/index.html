				  <p>&nbsp;  &nbsp; For Jews, the Western Wall is arguably the holiest spot on the planet. It is the last remnant of the second temple, and tangible evidence of God&#8217;s promise that it &#8220;would never be destroyed&#8221;.&nbsp; Every year, millions make pilgrimage to the wall to pray in it&#8217;s presence.&nbsp; Despite it&#8217;s importance it has earned only one nickname from gentiles over the years: The Wailing Wall. This is of course in reference to both what is interpreted as the sorrowful devotional prayer of jews at the wall and recognition of the site as a place of mourning the temple&#8217;s destruction.&nbsp; Though this name is in many ways apropos, it is a bit glum. So I thought that I might offer my two cents as to some alternatives that might pep it up a bit.&nbsp; In addition, with the recent dip in tourism to Israel, these ideas might make the wall more of a hotspot.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  1)The Great Wall of Israel: China&#8217;s got one.&nbsp; 2)The Western Wall-3D: Too long has this art form been confined to overpriced animated Pixar features. As soon as a visitor enters the old city, they are given a pair of glasses. Not only does it attract a new audience, but the slogan &#8216;See the Kotel for the first timeâ€¦.again&#8217; brings back the old one.&nbsp;   3) Wild Wild Western Wall: Perhaps this involves some sort of Vegas style stage show that happens at various times during the day (excluding Shabbat). The story would loosely incorporate the Jewish-Roman war but with cowboys and indians.&nbsp; Pyrotechnics and audience participation is a must.&nbsp; Tagline: &#8216;Where the Wild West Meets the Middle East!&#8217;&nbsp; 4) Disney Wall: This is a win/win partnership. Walt gets to make amends for his inflammatory behavior in the 1940s and Israel gets the benefits of one of the most powerful names in the world.&nbsp; The sales of Mickey mouse eared yarmulkes would skyrocket.&nbsp; 5)The Wishing Wall: Millions of people write down their prayers on a piece of paper each year and put them in the wall. Imagine if they did it with currency.&nbsp; 6)The Western Facebook Wall: I&#8217;m honestly not quite sure how this one would work but I do know that the play on words and the popularity of Facebook make it necessary. <br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp; Obviously my ideas are genius. They would bring more tourism and money than ever before to a region of the world that needs it. However, the fact they are not used (nor would they even be seriously considered) points to what is really important about this place.&nbsp; It is not a tourist trap. Since the destruction of the Temple in 70CE, Jews have been spread to every corner of the globe.&nbsp; But during the silent Amidah we turn towards Jerusalem.&nbsp; After all these years, this site remains the spiritual center of Judaism.&nbsp; It&#8217;s presence is a physical reminder of where we came from as a people, and that much like the wall we are still standing.
