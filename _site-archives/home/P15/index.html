			<p>
				  <p>My preschool teacher was concerned that I had developmental disabilities.<br />
So concerned in fact that she called my Mother into the school to discuss it.<br />
My Mother thanked her and asked what behavior I was displaying that would denote any sort of issue.<br />
At this point my teacher filled up a pitcher with water, gave me a cup and asked me to pour.<br />
I spilled the contents everywhere.<br />
&#8216;Use your left hand William&#8217; my Mother said.</p>

<p>Problem solved.</p>

<p>It hasn&#8217;t been easy growing up as a southpaw in a right handed world.<br />
The worst was learning to cut paper.<br />
Thats when they really separate the righties from the lefties.<br />
While everybody else got beautifully pointed, stainless steel blades with bright red handles I was forced to make do with the rounded off, puke green shears left rusting in an old Yuban coffee can branded with a giant &#8216;L&#8217;. <br />
Naturally, this was par for the course.<br />
Right handed desks.<br />
Right handed baseball mitts.<br />
Right handed guitars and can openers.<br />
Even the cords on credit card machines are on the right hand side so you have to stretch them awkwardly at an angle just to sign with your left hand.<br />
I&#8217;m reminded that about 90 percent of the world is right handed every time I go to shake somebody&#8217;s hand.<br />
But by and far the bane of my existence has been the fact that I cannot write more than a sentence without completely smudging the writing and discoloring the side of my palm as I drag it across the paper from left to right.<br />
And to top it off studies show that my lifespan is almost a decade shorter than the rest of you.</p>

<p>On the other hand (pun so very much intended) if I were a more pious man, its for this very reason that I&#8217;d probably make an excellent sofer.
