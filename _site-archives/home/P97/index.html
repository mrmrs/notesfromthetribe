				  <p>All suspected anti-Semitism aside, it&#8217;s shocking that Disney has yet to tap into the Jewish market.&nbsp; It seems as though the story of Purim is just ripe for an animated musical feature. Here you have Esther, an orphan turned Queen who, with the help of her good natured cousin (uncle? husband!?!?!)Mordechai,&nbsp; foils the plot of the King&#8217;s evil vizier, Haman, to destroy the Jewish people. It practically writes itself.&nbsp; True to formula, Esther would be a Jasmine/Ariel/Mulan hybrid, an atypical heroine who after getting wrapped up in royal life realizes that she must remember where she comes from and who she is in order to save her people. Mordechai would be sort of a Jiminy Cricket meets Genie type, the lovable moral compass of the story.&nbsp; Haman is of course Scar/Jafar/Frollo/ Every other Disney Villain, but this time with a pointy three-cornered hat.&nbsp; Naturally, being Disney, the story would have to be slightly bastardized.&nbsp; King Achashverosh could be played more as a bumbling idiot than a morally ambiguous womanizer.&nbsp; There would also have to be some sort of magical sidekick for comedic relief, as well as a handsome Persian soldier love interest.&nbsp; And in the end, rather than a giant melee in Shushan, the story would conclude with the king ordering that all the Jews be saved.&nbsp; Sprinkle in some show stopping tunes (by artists like Michael Bolton and Elton John) with titles like &#8220;Hey Man, Haman, Whaddya Say Man?&#8221;,&#8220;Mordechai, What A Guy!&#8221;, and &#8220;Esther, This Will Surely Test Her&#8221;, and you&#8217;ve got a surefire blockbuster on your hands. Apart from the box office success, the amount of Mickey Mouse shaped hamantashen and groggers alone makes this a viable property. There could even be a parade in Disneyland right around Purim where all the park characters masquerade in costumes while Goofy, dressed as Haman, is hung or burned in effigy.&nbsp; Oh well, maybe Robert Iger just isn&#8217;t ready, maybe the success of &#8216;&#8216;An American Tail&#8217;&#8217; wasn&#8217;t enough to prove that a Jewish story can be an animated feature, or maybe those crazy rumors about Walt in the 1940&#8217;s are true. Who knows?&nbsp;
