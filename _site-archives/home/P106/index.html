				  <p>I consumed absolutely no red meat between the months of January and December of 2003 due to the outbreak of mad cow disease in the United States. The following year I abstained from eating chicken due to rumors of avian flu, in spite of the fact that H2N2 can only be passed through the handling of poultry and not its consumption. To be safe, I ate only beef.&nbsp; Luckily, I had no problem doing without pork during the swine flu pandemic. I did, however, purchase a face mask, quarantine my infected roommate, placing food at a distance of six feet from her door, and sterilize the premises hourly.&nbsp; Despite precaution, I ultimately contracted a mild fever and cough, all the while awaiting my end. In 2002, I destroyed a compact disk of Savage Garden&#8217;s 1999 album, Affirmation, which a friend had burned, certain the FCC would find it and incarcerate me.&nbsp; During the summer of 2006, I convinced myself that I had burned down Griffith Park by lighting a birthday candle in a parking lot in Silver Lake. I reasoned that though the fire had not started until days later, the dry wind had picked up my old candle, sent it three miles away, and then rekindled the flame.&nbsp; It was not until the arsonist was found that I exonerated myself. In any given social situation I consider the real possibility of a nuclear attack or natural disaster.&nbsp; I walk down the middle of the street late at night so as to avoid surprise attacks from potential assailants.&nbsp; I once bought a pregnancy test for a lovely young woman I&#8217;d never been intimate with. When leaving my house I sometimes check the locks two or three times before going back inside and taking all the valuable objects with me. And, in doing all this, I sometimes wonder if maybe, just maybe, all of this anxiety, this excitable way I have about me, might have something to do with the fact that when I was a very young boy, a large man with a sharp pair of scissors ritually placed me naked in front of my family and friends and went about his business.&nbsp; Granted this is probably not the case and I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way. But, maybeâ€¦
