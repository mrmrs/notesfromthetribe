				  <p>My friend Brian spent his entire seventh grade summer practicing at a basketball camp. When he returned in the Fall it was clear his jump shot had vastly improved.<br />
Similarly, Gary had gone to space camp and was way ahead of us when it came to astronomy and physics.<br />
I went to Jewish sleep away camp that year and learned to french kiss.<br />
Indeed, though Gary had spent the past ten weeks involved in athletics it was I who had rounded first base.<br />
To be clear, I had kissed a girl before.<br />
Literally &#8216;a&#8217; girl.<br />
One.&nbsp; <br />
It was the result of an embarrassing game of truth or dare at a non parentally supervised graduation party I&#8217;d been to in the spring.<br />
But what separated that encounter from the one I&#8217;d experience later that summer was the european quality of the smooch.<br />
Specifically, tongue.<br />
Her name was Jen.<br />
We met after morning prayers on the ropes course.<br />
As part of trust building exercise we were instructed to fall into one another&#8217;s arms, taking turns catching and being caught.<br />
I was smitten.<br />
As was the protocol I had my bunkmate Jared ask her friend Michelle if she wanted to be my girlfriend at lunch.<br />
By free time that afternoon, we were an item.<br />
This meant she was to sit in my lap while we hung out with her friends on the hill.<br />
There we sat, saying nothing to each other while kids ate the junk food their parents sent carefully hidden in care packages.<br />
I had only had one girlfriend before that point, but this was the first one I had ever actually touched.<br />
The first female I had put my arm around that wasn&#8217;t related to me.<br />
That night, after activities, I took her for a walk near the amphitheater.<br />
It was common knowledge that this is where people went to &#8216;french&#8217; and we both knew it.<br />
I remembered the &#8216;birds and the bees&#8217; conversation my father and I had earlier that summer regarding technique:<br />
&#8216;You must explore every area of the woman&#8217;s mouth with your tongue&#8217;.<br />
Like most of his bad advice, it was well intentioned.<br />
It was messier than I had anticipated. <br />
Much more technical.<br />
I&#8217;d imagined two puzzle pieces coming together to form a beautiful picture.<br />
This was more like two anteaters frantically mashing noses together.<br />
Somehow it seemed more American than French.<br />
But I wasn&#8217;t complaining. <br />
As far as I was concerned this was a girl who once an evening allowed me to put my tongue in her mouth and for a thirteen year old boy that was good enough.<br />
The rest of the summer went on like this.<br />
Make no mistake, Jewish Camp lived up to its name.<br />
We ate kosher food, prayed three times a day and communed with nature in the hills of Ojai.<br />
It was both &#8216;Jewish&#8217; and a &#8216;Camp.&#8217;<br />
But what it was really about for me was an experience beyond words.
