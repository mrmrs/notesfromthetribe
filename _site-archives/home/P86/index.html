				  <p>Dear Diary,<br />
&nbsp;  Do you remember that camping trip my Dad has been promising to take me on for the past month? The one to mount Moriah? Well, today he finally took me.&nbsp; And I have to preface this by saying that I was completely stoked to go. I mean, things have been rough around here since we kicked out Ishmael and the idea of a vacation just seemed really nice.&nbsp; But this morning as we were packing up to go, he appeared to be very irritable.&nbsp; The entire hike up we didn&#8217;t joke, didn&#8217;t talk, didn&#8217;t even look at each other!&nbsp; So we finally reached the top of the mountain, and he looks like he&#8217;s about to cry, so….I ask him if anything is wrong, and with tears in his eyes he yells at me to gather wood.&nbsp; At this point I&#8217;m kind of freaking out.&nbsp; Here we are, in the middle of nowhere and he&#8217;s completely despondent, just frantically building an altar….and then he tells me to lay down on it.&nbsp; Now I&#8217;m legitimately afraid, but I do as he says.&nbsp; He binds my hands&#8212;tight. He starts talking to himself, arguing, pacing back and forth with a knife in his hand while I lay there completely subdued and shaking like a leaf. His back and forth becomes more and more frenzied, and in one fluid motion he plunges the blade toward me, and….SURPRISE!!!!!&nbsp; It was a joke!!!! Can you believe that !?!?!?!&nbsp; Oh man! My heart was beating like a million miles a minute!&nbsp; I mean I really thought he was going to kill me!!!&nbsp; The old man really got me good!!!&nbsp; He&#8217;s still got it.&nbsp; Anyway, we had a good laugh and he explained that he brought me up there so we could have a good ol&#8217; father and son hunting trip together. Luckily there was a ram caught in a thicket nearby that we could easily slaughter, so we made our sacrifice and headed back down the mountain.&nbsp; Dad admitted that he couldn&#8217;t take all of the credit, because God came up with the initial idea.&nbsp; But man oh man, it&#8217;ll teach me not to mess with those two practical jokers!!! Though for a prank, he did seem oddly relieved. Anyway, that was the best camping trip ever.<br />

Talk to you tomorrow diary! You&#8217;re my best friend…well besides my Dad!<br />

Love, Isaac.
