				  <p>I&#8217;ve heard Purim referred to as &#8216;The Jewish Mardi Gras&#8217;.<br />
This is an understandable oversight.<br />
Granted, both are celebrations that involve masquerade, carnivals, beauty pageants, the baking of special pastries,inebriation, and all around general reverie. <br />
That said, I have never once a seen a drunken woman remove her top in exchange for some plastic beads during a reading of the Megillah.<br />
Maybe I&#8217;m going to the wrong synagogues.
