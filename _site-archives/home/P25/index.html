			<p>
				  <p>I was born in Laguna Beach on November 20, 1983 with a few inalienable rights.<br />
Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the opportunity to take an all expenses paid trip to Israel between the ages of 18 and 26.<br />
Though I&#8217;ve debatably enjoyed the first three, at the age of 28 it seems that I have missed my window to that last one.<br />
Granted, my parents kind of blew it when they sent me there (all expenses paid by them) at 16.<br />
And while I would certainly have an entirely new perspective as an adult, I can&#8217;t imagine that the scheduled activities would be that much different from when I was a teenager.<br />
See some holy sites, walk around in nature, rub some mud on myself and of course ride a camel.<br />
Only this time with alcohol.<br />
This is not to diminish the experience. Indeed such programs have a matter of days to show the entirety of the holy land and moreover have proven to be absolutely transformative to those who participate.&nbsp; Rather I&#8217;m pointing out that though the backgrounds of the people who attend them are far ranging, the trip itself has become iconic. Ritualistic in its own right.&nbsp; A snapshot for young Americans of what its like to live in a Jewish state.<br />
I wonder what it would be like if the situation were reversed. What if the Jewish community spent millions of dollars flying young Israelis to Los Angeles to give them an &#8216;authentic Los Angeles Jewish experience&#8217; what would that look like? <br />
Perhaps a visit to the studio heads?<br />
Then maybe a jaunt to a Whole Foods in the Valley.<br />
Pastrami at Langers.<br />
A walk around Pico Robertson<br />
Then off to a JDate mixer.<br />
And though we don&#8217;t have camels in the desert, traffic on the 405 is equally as hot, slow and uncomfortable.
