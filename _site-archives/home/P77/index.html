				  <p>&nbsp;  Perhaps Rap&#8217;s biggest contribution to the spoken word was the phonic device &#8216;ah&#8217;.&nbsp; This tool made it possible to rhyme words that end in -er with words that end in  -ou and occasionally could be used to create entirely new words. For example in Jay-Z&#8217;s 1998 single &#8216;Can I Get Aâ€¦&#8217; he speaks the following words:<br />
&#8220;Do you need a ball-ah<br />
To go shopping at the mall-ah<br />
Brag, tell your friends what I bought y-ah&#8221;<br />
Brilliantly, three dissimilar words are brought together by one sound. Unfortunately, I am not rapper.&nbsp; As this is the case I found it very hard to rhyme anything with &#8216;Challah&#8217;, save for one word in the second to last line of the following sonnet I wrote:</p>

<p>Oh delicious loaves of braided bread<br />
Both are uncovered on Friday night as a group<br />
And are quickly torn apart instead <br />
To be used as mops for sauce and soup<br />
Come Saturday morning there is only one loaf left<br />
It will get exactly what it deserves<br />
So into slices it is cleft <br />
and covered with butter and preserves<br />
After all of this, should any remain<br />
Remember to keep it in boxes or bags with covers<br />
By all means do not refrain<br />
From using it to make sandwiches with leftovers.<br />
Whether you enjoy Kabbalat Shabbat, the torah service or Havdallah<br />
Come the weekend, it&#8217;s hard to argue with a good ol&#8217; piece of Challah.</p>
