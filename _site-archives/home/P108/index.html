				  <p>Dear Bar Mitzvah boy,<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp; It&#8217;s not your fault. Despite the uncontrollable acne, the braces that have at least three years to come off, even though you&#8217;ve only just made the transition from briefs to boxer shorts and the only bare bosom you&#8217;ve come close to is your mother&#8217;s long ago, with no house, no property, no prospects, not even a bathroom of your own; you&#8217;ve awoken one fine morning at the tender age of 13, a full grown man. What does this mean for you? Well, if you didn&#8217;t already, you&#8217;ll be spending a lot more time in synagogueâ€” actually in it this time, not out in the lobby or in the parking lot with friends. Don&#8217;t worry; their time will come soon enough. Though you&#8217;re told that this is your big day, admittedly it&#8217;s a slight misnomer; your mother will be making all the preparations. She will, however, ask for your opinion as this is ultimately your decision and yours alone. And, if you decide to let down your entire family, extended relatives, community at large and culture as a whole by turning your back on a time honored tradition, that is completely your choice. Though the parsha you will be reading is more or less delegated by the month of your birth, it is important to explain in your speech how it uniquely relates to you and your relationship with Judaism, how the experience of being driven to haftorah practice each week and possibly collecting canned food or cleaning up a beach has strengthened your position as a Jew in the world. Oh, and don&#8217;t forget to thank everyone (consider using a well mannered jibe at sibling or parent for comedic effect).&nbsp; If at any point on the bimah your voice should stop, stutter, or crack, DO NOT PANIC.&nbsp;   Your performance, no matter how bad, will be met with only the highest accolades by relatives and friends.&nbsp; Your out-of-town guests will assure you that it was well worth the flight from London, the delay in New York and the restless sleep on the old fold-out in the living room to hear a torah portion that divine. These sentiments, of course, will all be echoed in the slurry of speeches from community and clergy members alike, each tearfully attesting that what has happened this morning and the months leading up to it is nothing short of a small miracle. This must all seem like a lot of trouble for your thirteenth birthday, but look at it this way: once you&#8217;re an adult, you won&#8217;t have to come back to synagogue until High Holidays.<br />
Happy Birthday, Will.
