			<p>	
				  <p>If you could have tasted my mother&#8217;s challah in 1984, it would not have shocked anyone but her to know that a decade or so later she would be a Cantor.&nbsp; She began by removing her wedding ring. Next, the ingredients were measured and mixed, kneaded and braided, and baked into what became the crown jewel of Friday night dinners. The standard was poppy seed, occasionally sesame, and a few failed experiments with raisin and wheat.&nbsp;  Each was characterized by a crisp golden exterior which gave way to a soft buttery bliss.&nbsp; This was the bread that served as mops for sauce, a spoon for soup, and casing for midweek leftovers.&nbsp; Any person who can put that much ruach into a  loaf of dough is bound to find other outlets for it.&nbsp; So it came as no surprise when my mother announced that she would be serving as Rabbi for our congregation&#8217;s sisterhood Shabbat.&nbsp; The challah barely made it to the table that week, but her sermon was superb.&nbsp; She had discovered that her mastery of the sabbath extended outside the reaches of the kitchen.&nbsp; And when my great uncle, Cantor David Gordon passed away, it seemed only fitting that she should take up the mantle. However, being a woman Cantor in your 40&#8217;s with no formal training in the saturated market of Orange County where there are more gated communities than jewish people does not make things easy. So she hit the streets and started working the circuit.&nbsp; In addition to making delicious food each week, my mother began her training as an assistant Cantor at our synagogue, learning the ropes of leading prayer. Life was more or less how it had been before, I would get two loaves a week in return for sitting through what I considered to be unbearable drudgery at the time. But the people wanted more.&nbsp; Soon she was working paid gigs.&nbsp; Friday night stuff.&nbsp; The folks over at Villa Valencia wanted her to be their clergy in residence.&nbsp; It began to dawn on me that the cornucopia of carbohydrates was running dry.&nbsp; While I could look forward to the home cooked stuff now and again, the amount of preparation required for Kabbalat Shabbat meant that I was stuck with the occasional store-bought starch.&nbsp; Then came the big time.&nbsp; After a brief stint at B&#8217;nai Israel, and working for years as a part time spiritual advisor, my mother found her home as Cantor of Heritage Pointe.&nbsp; And I said hello to frozen challah.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not so bad though. In a way I was lucky. Some kids only get to hear services once a week. I got to hear them every day. All my friends had to go to the temple to learn their haftorah, I got to say mine every night for a year before I went to bed. Oh and the bread is pretty good too- once you toast it.
