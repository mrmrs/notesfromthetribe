			<p>	
				  <p>When I was in 3rd grade I was taught how to use an abacus.<br />
For the uninitiated, an abacus is a calculating tool that was adopted before written numeral systems and used beans or stones in grooved mechanisms to perform basic arithmetic.<br />
Three days were dedicated to this particular subject.<br />
Real abacuses were brought in and we were tested on our ability to solve addition and subtraction problems by sliding the beads back and forth on a wire frame.<br />
It was explained to us that though we had fancy Texas Instrument solar powered calculators it was essential to know how to do math without them.<br />
Conversely, around that same age I was also enrolled in a Tae Kwon Do class.<br />
I grew up in the age of the Karate Kid and anything that involved wearing a gi had my full attention.<br />
Moreover, as a small, oft picked on child with an older brother and a younger sister this was knowledge that was directly applicable to my life.<br />
Finally I was learning something that I could actually use.<br />
At long last, not only would I be able to defend myself but also physically intimidate those who stood in my way.<br />
No longer would I be at the mercy of those who wished to take my seat on the bus or cut in front of me in line.<br />
All who wished to bully me would know my wrath.<br />
So when I was told by my Sensei during the first day of class that I was to learn the martial arts so that I would &#8216;never have to use them&#8217; the idea seemed patently absurd. Did this man not know the definition of his own subject? This was the art of war for crying out loud! Furthermore, if I did not intend to use it why would I or any other small child be taking this class?&nbsp; Did he understand the amount of ridicule you get as the child who hasn&#8217;t hit his growth spurt?&nbsp; Had he not seen the end of the Karate Kid when a beaten and bruised Daniel Laruso busts out a crane kick to defeat the Cobra Kai Dojo and defend his honor (Cue Joe Esposito&#8217;s &#8216;You&#8217;re The Best Around&#8217;)?<br />
Of course that was Karate and this was Tae Kwon Do.<br />
I dropped out shortly thereafter.<br />
To this day, 21 years later, I have not touched an abacus.<br />
However as a 29 year old who still has yet to hit his growth spurt there is rarely a week that passes that I don&#8217;t think some part of me might want to know how to defend himself.<br />
Maybe I should start taking Krav Maga.<br />
With its combination of threat neutralization and aggressive counter attacks it is made for the real world.<br />
Though hopefully I won&#8217;t have to use it.
