				  <p>Dear Adam,</p>

<p>I’m a little hurt. I feel like haven’t seen you since the sixth day.&nbsp;  It seems all you do since that floozy  was created from your rib is galavant around naked naming animals.&nbsp; Speaking of which….serpent?&nbsp;   I know I walk on four legs, but that’s a little harsh. Anyhow, I’m just writing to let you know that your so-called “companion” should be arriving any minute with an apple and a RIDICULOUS story about how I convinced her to eat it. Nothing could be further from the truth. Maybe the Big Guy should have made her from your head and and not your side, because she tends to think with her stomach and not her brain….am I right or am I right!?!&nbsp; Like I said, do not eat it.&nbsp; And between you and me, if you want to just let her take a bite, we can get her out of here and really make this place paradise like the old days! YEAH!&nbsp; </p>

<p>Love, the Serpent.<br />
(we’ll talk about my name later, I was thinking maybe you could call me a lawyer or car mechanic)
