			<p>
				  <p>The Bark Mitzvah, first introduced in 1977, combines the age old Jewish tradition of B&#8217;nai mitzvah with the age old Jewish tradition of making awful puns. </p>

<p>At the age of 13 months, owners throw a party for their pet and dress them in a yarmulke and tallis for the occasion.</p>

<p>While some see it as a desecration of sacred practices, others see it as a way to mark their dog&#8217;s transition into adulthood.</p>

<p>Regardless, the owner is still required to pick up their excrement.
