  As of June 2010, I will have been cursed for 14 years. I’m not sure of the
  specifics of the initial hex, nor what the shelf life is on a spell of its
  kind, but I can tell you that it was put on me at the age of 12 during eighth
  grade by a boy who will remain nameless. His reasoning for going to the
  extreme of sorcery, as I can understand it best, had to do with a girl in our
  class who he fancied, and to whom I was romantically linked.&nbsp; Make no
  mistake; I was not a Don Juan, far from it. The caste system of junior high
  made it very clear that my prepubescent body and slight lisp were fit for
  sitting against a wall at lunch and being picked last in P.E.&nbsp; However,
  a leading role as the Scarecrow in our winter production of “The Wizard of
  OZ” made my social mobility much more fluid. I began to intermingle with the
  elite of eighth grade society.&nbsp; So, when the aforementioned girl decided
  that I was to be her mate, etiquette dictated that I, as the less popular
  one, had no say in the matter.&nbsp; We were to be boyfriend and girlfriend
  whether I liked it or not.&nbsp; I was to hold her hand during prospective
  lunch times in a designated area near the library. It’s not that she wasn’t
  pretty, she was; Jewish even. But I found the prospect of adolescent dating
  an altogether terrifying endeavor.&nbsp; I didn’t know what to say to
  somebody whose interests didn’t include role-playing games, nor was I
  well-versed in the kissing style of the French.&nbsp; Moreover, I missed my
  friends terribly. Had the young warlock, with his Doc Marten shoes and
  Marilyn Manson t-shirt, asked me for her hand I would have gladly given it.
  For those of you who, up to this point, believe I am using the term ‘curse’
  as a euphemism, let me explain that he literally bought a book of spells,
  recited incantations and informed me in homeroom that he had, in fact, cursed
  me.&nbsp; My parents did not take this news lightly.&nbsp; My father dabbled
  in metaphysics, and my mother believed in the clairvoyant power of dreams.
  Both strongly believed in the power that an evil inclination can have.&nbsp;
  Rather than reassuring me that things like a curse only hold power to those
  who believe them, my father gave me a hamsa (the necklace to left of this
  post) , and my mother advised me to wrap a red band around my arm to protect
  me from the evil eye. It was too late. The curse had done its work.&nbsp; A
  week later, the girl in question broke up with me because I refused to sully
  my tongue in her mouth.&nbsp; I was cursed. And, I was relieved.&nbsp; Since
  then, things have been looking up for the most part, I’ve had my heart broken
  a few times, my hair is thinning a little and I occasionally get acid reflux
  after eating spicy food.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe the curse is wearing off.
  Maybe after all these years he took it back. I still keep a hamsa in my
  pocket and a band around my arm, just in case.
