				  <p>Edible Arrangements is a company that designs bouquets of fruit for any occasion.&nbsp; In the case of funerals they &#8216;offer a wide selection of thoughtful and delicious gift options to make giving a sympathy gift just a little bit easier&#8217;.&nbsp; The &#8216;You&#8217;re In Our Thoughts&#8217; basket contains an assortment of grapes, cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberries, chocolate dipped strawberries and pineapple daisies.&nbsp; A large order is meant to serve 15 people.&nbsp; The day my father passed away, we received 10 of them. This was understandable.&nbsp; Considering that it was erev pesach and my brother had a strictly kosher diet, this gesture seemed the perfect way to provide food, whilst extending ones condolences. </p>

<p>A bereaved family of four with no appetite and food for 150 people. </p>

<p>The most tedious part was detaching the small sticks that were used to hold it all together. Everything was grouped in the order it was received. Fruit for seder. Fruit for the meal of comfort. Fruit for shiva. The melons stayed surprisingly fresh while the integrity of the chocolate seemed to be compromised by refrigeration. It&#8217;s been two years and I still can&#8217;t look at a fruit platter without thinking of my father. Ironically his only notion of live food was an animal before it was slaughtered.<br />
Do me a favor. <br />
When my mother dies, send me steak.
