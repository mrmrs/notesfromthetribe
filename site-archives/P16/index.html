				  <p>My Mother recalls the following:</p>

<p>She was going out for an evening of theatre and had dressed accordingly.<br />
A fancy gown, makeup, perfume and her naturally curly hair coiffed perfectly atop her head.<br />
A vision to behold.<br />
Upon entering the theatre a woman stopped her to remark on her appearance.<br />
&#8216;Excuse me&#8217; she exclaimed &#8216;But where did you get that absolutely stunning perm?!&#8217;<br />
My Mother, both surprised and flattered to receive such a compliment in regard to her God-given locks coyly replied &#8216;Mother Nature&#8217;.<br />
Without hesitation the woman responded &#8216;Oh,where are they located?&#8217;
