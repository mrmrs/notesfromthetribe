				  <p>Most people in High School assumed that I was gay.<br />
Given my situation, this was understandable.<br />
To the narrow-minded Orange County adolescent I fit all the stereotypes.<br />
I was small.<br />
I was bad at sports.<br />
I was interested in the arts.<br />
I could dance.<br />
I had a slight lisp due to grinding my teeth as a child.<br />
I wore a messenger bag.<br />
But most importantly, I didn&#8217;t date women.<br />
I didn&#8217;t date men either. I just didn&#8217;t date, period.<br />
This was due to the fact that I had been strictly prohibited from courting goyim.<br />
Considering there were at most five eligible Jewish women in my school who were all out of my league, it meant I would have to find a mating pool elsewhere.<br />
But where? Two words: the valley.<br />
An hour up the 405 freeway was an entire town seemingly inundated with Jewish women just waiting to be kissed.<br />
Back in 1999 it was like walking into an N&#8217;Sync music video.&nbsp; Everybody drove a sports utility vehicle with a compact disc player just to get around the suburbs.&nbsp; There was valet parking everywhere.&nbsp;  And the women.&nbsp; They wore giant sunglasses with shaded lenses, rhinestones, leather pants, faux snakeskin pants, jean skirts, Abercrombie and Fitch, bedazzled bandanas and heart shaped Tiffany&#8217;s charms.&nbsp; They referred to themselves as &#8216;Japs&#8217;, though most often as &#8216;Jappy.&#8217;<br />
I didn&#8217;t understand.&nbsp;  <br />
Not only did the name seem downright derogatory, but they didn&#8217;t look Japanese to me.<br />
It was explained to me that there was certain pride in being a Jewish American princess.&nbsp; A modern re-appropriation and incorporation of the slur into cultural identity.&nbsp; In fact the impetus for this week&#8217;s post came from a friend of mine who is a self proclaimed &#8216;Jewish American Princess.&#8217;&nbsp;  Over a discussion at the Whole Foods off Coldwater, I explained that I was working on a series of images of contemporary Jewish life.&nbsp; She peered at me over her Chanel sunglasses and said &#8216;draw a picture of a Jap, I&#8217;d buy one.&#8217;&nbsp;   On her license plate frame reads the following phrase: &#8216;I&#8217;m not spoiled, just well taken care of.&#8217;<br />
And yes, its an SUV.
