				  <p>An epiphany is defined as a moment of realization.&nbsp; Mine came whilst urinating in front of two dancing Hassidic Jews at a shivah minyan of all places.&nbsp; I was, of course, in the restroom, and the two men were encased in a glass frame that hung above the toilet. At that moment, it occurred to me that this was not the first time the three of us had met in such a fashion. In fact, growing up in the Orthodox, and later, when my mother joined the Cantorate, the Conservative community, one thing had remained constant:the art.&nbsp;  Regardless of denomination, nearly every Jewish house I went to had the same three defining aesthetics: 1)Chagall prints 2)Tacky abstract 80&#8217;s metal wall sculpture and 3) Pictures of frum Jews dancing and/or playing some sort of Klezmer instrument in or around the bathroom. In spite of these similarities, I found that none of this work spoke about the modern Jewish experience.&nbsp; In my family alone there is a Conservative Cantor, an observant Orthodox Jew, an atheist, and an agnostic; yet, all of us identify strongly as Jews.&nbsp; So I took it upon myself to make paintings that encapsulate the essence of what it is that ties us all together.&nbsp; The result is this ongoing collection of work I call “Notes from the Tribe.”&nbsp; Each week I&#8217;ll release a limited archival print of work available for purchase along with a few words.&nbsp; I invite you to leave your own notes, comments, and suggestions on the site, as the views expressed don&#8217;t come from the tribe itself, just one of its loving members. </p>

<p>-Will </p>

<p>p.s. A little bit about me; my name is Will, I studied art at UCLA and currently live in Los Angeles obsessively making pictures.&nbsp; Were I at all athletically inclined, my life may have gone a completely different direction, but as it stands my 5&#8217;7&#8217;&#8217; frame was suitable for mostly cerebral and cultural pursuits. Oh, and the red stamp is a signature of my Hebrew name as spelled by a five year old me. In learning the alef-bet, I found the difference between a chet and a final mem perplexing, but I like the unpredictability of life, so I kept it.&nbsp;   </p>
