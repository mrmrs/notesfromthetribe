				  <p>One minor confession.<br />
On September 26th 2000, I went to FYE and purchased a copy of the R and B group 98 Degrees&#8217; album Revelation the day it came out.<br />
It was the follow up to my favorite of their records, &#8216;98 Degrees and Rising.&#8217;<br />
Full disclosure: I was a closeted boy band fanatic. <br />
N&#8217;Sync. <br />
Backstreet Boys.<br />
LFO. <br />
BBMak.<br />
Westlife.<br />
Even O-Town (I selfishly bought the C.D. for my sister&#8217;s birthday).<br />
Though I can now come to grips with this in sort of an ironic-hipster-its-so-uncool-that-it-is-cool way….much how I&#8217;ve accepted my obsession with the card game Magic The Gathering…..as a sixteen year old male trying to fit into a mold of classic teenage masculinity it was a closely guarded secret.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I also genuinely enjoyed other kinds of music ranging from grunge to hip hop, but there was something about these crooners that spoke to my sensibilities. <br />
It wasn&#8217;t their style….I would&#8217;ve never frosted my tips or worn rhinestone bandanas.<br />
Nor their dance moves….in fact I wasn&#8217;t crazy about the club hits that got radio play.<br />
I think it was their soulful, unabashed expressions of love towards the women they sung about.<br />
Much like Nick Lachey sings on 1997&#8217;s&#8217; &#8216;98 Degrees&#8217; I often felt like the &#8216;Invisible Man.&#8217;&nbsp; <br />
I wanted a love that was &#8216;like a river, peaceful and deep&#8217; and knew all too well of females that wouldn&#8217;t &#8216;quit playing games with my heart.&#8217;<br />
I was a romantic. <br />
I still am.<br />
Yet with all this talk of love, I&#8217;ve never given more than a passing thought to my own wedding.&nbsp; <br />
I&#8217;m not terrified of marriage, I just don&#8217;t think about it all that much.<br />
Some people know exactly what that day is going to look like for them down to the place cards.<br />
For some reason, the only thing I&#8217;m sure of is that I want to have a Round Table cheese pizza light cheese extra sauce on a thin crust waiting for me at the reception.<br />
It&#8217;s something I came up with when I was six.<br />
Weird,I know.<br />
Oh, I also know a few of the songs we&#8217;ll be playing…..
