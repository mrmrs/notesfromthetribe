				  <p>&nbsp;  Lets try an experiment.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to type a word and you tell me the first three words that pop into your head. Here goes……</p>

<p>Jew.</p>

<p>So&#8230;Intelligent? Sardonic? Kafka-esque perhaps?<br />
What about the word athletic?&nbsp; I&#8217;m guessing not.&nbsp; While we may hold 22% of all Nobel prizes we have won only a single ESPY (Jason Lezak). Now i&#8217;ve heard arguments on the subject ranging from nurture (we encourage intellectual pursuits) to nature (we&#8217;re just not built athletically).&nbsp; These may hold some water, but from a historical perspective, I blame the Maccabees.&nbsp;  Judah Maccabee hated competitive sports.&nbsp; Indeed, he publicly condemned them as a hellenistic influence from the Greeks and abolished athletic displays once he rededicated the second temple. It makes sense to me: a culture that outlaws sports would not be very good at them.&nbsp; Now there are of course exceptions to this rule.&nbsp; And we as Jews are very proud of these exceptions.&nbsp; Which is why I&#8217;ve never watched a single game of baseball, but I know who Sandy Koufax is.&nbsp; Judah Maccabee&#8217;s decree is of course ironic for two reasons: 1).Because Judah Maccabee might be the only biblical Jew besides Samson considered buff (His nickname was &#8216;The Hammer&#8217; for crying out loud. The only person I&#8217;ve ever met nicknamed the Hammer was a quarterback from the midwest with abs you could grate cheese on and a dead ringer for Captain Planet minus the green hair and blue pallor) and 2) Maccabi, the athletic commission in Israel is named after him.&nbsp;  The Maccabia games, held every year in Israel, are truly a tribute to Jewish athleticism in the 21st century.&nbsp; I am proud to say that not only did I compete in them in the year 2000, but I brought home a gold medal.&nbsp; It was of course for the most grueling portion…Talent. Take that Judah Maccabee.
