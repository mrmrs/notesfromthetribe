			<p>	
				  <p>The prize for finding the afikoman in my house was 5 dollars.<br />
To put this in context, the starting pay for chores at the age of five was a nickel and this rate was raised five cents every birthday.<br />
This means that finding the wrapped up piece of shmura matzo was equivalent to anywhere from 6 months to just under 2 years salary.<br />
Needless to say, this was a coveted reward.</p>

<p>My brother won this purse every year for the first seven years of his life.&nbsp; Unimpeded by siblings, finding the afikoman was merely a formality to the end of the seder.&nbsp; This was until I turned 2, and could walk. Granted, there was a five year age difference between us, but my parents allowed me a handicap.&nbsp; As a toddler, not only was I given a head start, but the adults gently &#8216;guided me&#8217; in the direction of the &nbsp; &#8216;hidden napkin&#8217; glaringly dangling out of the couch cushion right in front of my face. Some years my brother didn&#8217;t even get to look.&nbsp; As I got older, and my motor skills more advanced, the competition became fierce.&nbsp; My father took great joy in the hiding.&nbsp; My mother who didn&#8217;t want the house destroyed came up with two simple rules:1)It could not be in the entertainment center, the dining room, the kitchen, any of the bedrooms, the bathrooms, the garage, or any cabinets  and 2)We were not to make a mess, everything had to be cleaned up.&nbsp; What this amounted to was my brother and I gingerly walking around the living room, gently sorting through magazines and under tables.&nbsp; My brother, being the smarter of the two of us, took a detective-like approach to this endeavor.&nbsp; Before looking, he would rule out the places that it couldn&#8217;t be based on where it had been hidden in years past.&nbsp; Then he would systematically go about the living room removing objects one by one. I however had a much more opportunistic strategy.&nbsp; I would pretend to look for the afikoman very close by him.&nbsp; Right when he found it, I would lunge and seize it, flailing it about in the air, exclaiming victory.&nbsp; With no referee (my parents were in the other room talking to their friends) it was his word against mine and as the younger of two I always got my way. <br />
By the time my sister came into the picture the finding of the afikoman had been split into two age categories. Uninterested in winning Beanie Babies, I opted out of the &#8216;ten and under&#8217; search.&nbsp; He may have won it now and a gain, I might have even let him have a few, but for the most part when it came to Passover I was ten dollars richer. The money was of course inevitably squandered on the two vices we were denied: junk food and video games.
