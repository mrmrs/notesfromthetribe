				  <p>	As a child, I used to hope that something horrible would happen to me. <br />
I was not sado-masochistic by any stretch, I just wanted to be a little darkerâ€¦.a little more tortured.&nbsp; The kind of thing that when revealed to a cute girl in my class, would make her  reach for my shoulder to comfort me, at which point I&#8217;d calmly brush it away and say &#8216;You can&#8217;t help me, I&#8217;m messed up, Okay?&#8217; This is of course would only stoke her desires.&nbsp; She&#8217;d feel an instant connection to me and I to her as we shared my dark past.<br />
I secretly wished that my father would hit me, that my parents would die in a car crash, that I had an incurable disease, that I would be kidnapped and held for ransom in someone&#8217;s basement, that I had survived an attack from wild animals, that I had spent years in correctional facilities for manslaughter, or that I  would find out that I had been adopted.<br />
Anything that would leave physical or emotional scars.<br />
But alas, nothing ever did.<br />
There was some shouting and the occasional punishment, but as it was I lead a mostly charmed life in the suburbs of Orange County.<br />
Jonah on the other hand was thrown overboard during a storm and swallowed by a giant fish.<br />
He must&#8217;ve gotten all the chicks.
