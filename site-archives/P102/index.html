<p>Michael Bay. What a Tzadik.&nbsp; <br />
Upon viewing the director&#8217;s 1998 big screen epic, Armageddon, it is clear that the film was intended to be a modern day  telling of Noah&#8217;s ark through the character of Harry Stamper (played by Bruce Willis).&nbsp;   Like his biblical counterpart, Harry is a simple man charged with saving the human race from certain extinction.&nbsp; While Noah had to build a large boat to survive a great flood, Harry must build a large drill to dig into a comet the size of Texas in order to detonate a nuclear warhead.&nbsp; Noah takes two of every animal with him, Harry must bring two of every astronaut and drill team member so as to have a failsafe.&nbsp;  In the Torah, God&#8217;s covenant to never again send a deluge is symbolized by a beautiful rainbow.&nbsp;  Similarly, at the end of the movie a brilliant light illuminates the sky from the explosion of the comet thus signifying that humanity has been saved. Granted, there are some key differences. Noah is chosen by God because of his character, Harry on the other hand is a shoe in because he is the best oil driller on the planet.&nbsp; In one story it could be said that God spared the earth, while in the other man saved it. Ultimately this leads to Noah repopulating the earth while Harry must sacrifice himself by staying on the doomed rock.&nbsp; More than a tour de force blockbuster nominated for four Oscars and winner of two MTV awards and a Teen Choice award (Best actor: Ben Affleck), this is a two hour and twenty four minute drash cautioning us that the same fate beset us in Genesis is still a possibility today.&nbsp; Whether you&#8217;re an atheist or interpret the bible literally, there is little doubt that from war, to disease, to natural disaster, terrible things happen.&nbsp; In either view it could also be said that mankind is the cause of this whether through incurring the wrath of the almighty or killing each other, changing our ecosystem and effecting climate change. But what these two stories point out are that whether it is through our own piety or ingenuity, the power to save the world ultimately lies in our hands. <br />
Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me I&#8217;m going to go and re-watch Bad Boys part one and two and look for allegories to Cain and Abel.<br />
Love, Will</p>

<p>P.S. Michael Bay also donated all of his Bar Mitzvah money to an animal shelter. True story. You can Wikipedia it.<br />
