				  <p>JDate.<br />
It&#8217;s a bit like rocking out front row at a Jonas Brother&#8217;s concert only to lock eyes with someone you know mid fist pump. There&#8217;s a moment of embarrassment cut short by the acknowledgment that both of you came for the same thing. In this case it&#8217;s the sweet sweet musical stylings of Joe and the gang, and in the case of Jdate it&#8217;s romance.&nbsp;  And why should you be ashamed of online dating? The general rule of thumb is as follows: if Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have made a movie about it, chances are that it is romantic. This would also explain why the duo haven&#8217;t made a movie about getting drunk and meeting someone at a bar.&nbsp;  But really it makes sense, if you were looking for kosher meat, would you go to a treif butcher?&nbsp; Now to extend the metaphor even further, imagine that not only is JDate a kosher butcher, but they have the largest meat market in the world, so you should be able to find just the cut you&#8217;re looking for.<br />
That said, there are still those of us who have trouble meeting someone online, so I&#8217;ve come up with some general guidelines to get you started.<br />
RULE#1 Pictures are everything: Using your head shot says: I only look this good with makeup, studio lighting, and heavy photoshopping. Using multiple photos of you from one angles says: yes, I have horrible scarring and/or a glass eye on the other side. Pictures of you holding a drink with somebody&#8217;s hand reaching in the frame says: I&#8217;m only this interesting when I&#8217;m drunk, but don&#8217;t worryâ€¦.I&#8217;m drunk a lot.&nbsp; Photos of yourself taken shirtless in the mirror with a camera phone say: I enjoy curling up with a good novel.<br />
RULE#2 What&#8217;s in a name?: I get it. You chose the screen name &#8216;Thuganomics&#8217; because you&#8217;re a sensible business man with your finger on the pulse of the streets. The problem is she won&#8217;t.&nbsp; <br />
RULE#3 Know your audience, play up your attributes..but be honest: Liking movies does not make you a nerd. Nor does cooking or listening to music. Owning a dungeon master manual may. Conversely, enjoying sports is different than playing them.&nbsp; Oh, and if you have to say that you&#8217;re creative, crazy, or down to earth, chances are you&#8217;re probably not.<br />
Follow these  rules and you&#8217;ll be well on your way to being &#8216;flirted with&#8217; or possibly even &#8216;hotlisted&#8217;.&nbsp;   Fundamentally, the goal of all of this electronic communication is to hopefully at long last interact with a living, breathing, person.&nbsp; As for that, you&#8217;re on your own.
