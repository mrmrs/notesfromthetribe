<h4 class="post-title twelve columns alpha"><a href="../home/entry/four_sons/index.html" class="ten columns alpha"><span>Notes from</span> <time>09.05.14</time></a></h4>
			
			<p>	
				  <p>My Father was one of four brothers.<br />
He often felt like the black sheep of the family.<br />
Whether this was actually true or not I&#8217;ll never know, but he had a habit of bringing it up every Passover when the topic of the four sons came up. For the unacquainted:&nbsp; The Passover story mentions four sons: one who is wise, one who is wicked, one who is simple and one that doesn&#8217;t even know how to ask a question.<br />
&#8216;Can you guess which one my family thought I was?&#8217; My Father would ask each year with a wry grin.<br />
This was usually followed with a bout of polite silence from dinner guests who didn&#8217;t want to answer the rhetorical question.<br />
&#8216;The Wicked one Papa&#8217; one of us would say so as to break the tension.<br />
&#8216;That&#8217;s right.&#8217; Then he&#8217;d flash a knowing glance across the table and continue reading. <br />
It was a Deutsch family tradition.<br />
I think for him it was a badge of honor. A way of feeling secure about what he saw as his place. <br />
He was, after all not what people would necessarily define as &#8216;likable&#8217;.&nbsp; To be clear I liked him very much, but social graces were not his strong suit. More like an ill fitting one that he constantly struggled to wear. <br />
The problem was that he was often vocally right about things that people were perfectly comfortable being wrong about. It was the engineer in him. He&#8217;d find the problem you didn&#8217;t ask to be fixed. Always well meaning and often ill received. The kind of man who would sit in the corner at a party waiting for something to break so he could brandish his Leatherman and go to work.<br />
But back to the story of the 4 sons.<br />
By labeling himself as &#8216;wicked&#8217; my Father was affirming his position as an outsider. Something apart from the other three.&nbsp; This was how he felt and for him this was true. <br />
My interpretation of the story however is quite different.<br />
The way I see it, the interesting thing about this story is that even though the wicked son is contrary, he is never asked to leave the table.<br />
He&#8217;s part of the Seder. Not only is he not excluded, he&#8217;s included. He serves an integral purpose.&nbsp; <br />
So what then?<br />
Go with me on this. <br />
This story, like the others in the Haggadah is a metaphor. Here we have four sons with four different ways of looking at the same old tale. But lets imagine for a second that these four sons represent the 4 stages of development that we all go through in our own belief systems.<br />
We all start off as infants. Unable to ask our own questions.<br />
When we grow into childhood, we are like simple son. We believe the stories that we&#8217;re told. Whether its the tooth fairy or some sort of internalized belief system. We may wrestle with certain facts, but the deeper implications and nuances are often lost. <br />
But its not until we become mature critical thinkers that we are able to question what has been put before us.&nbsp; It is in this fertile stage that we are able to reject certain illusions and falsehoods. Only through the skepticism that comes with &#8216;wickedness&#8217; is it possible reach a stage of true wisdom and understanding.<br />
But this brings me to the fifth character of this saga. <br />
The Father.<br />
He is the man who sits at the table with his four quarreling sons and allows them each their own unique opinion while giving them firm boundaries. <br />
This was the man my own Father actually was.<br />
Somebody who gave me a framework that allowed for my own questioning, doubts and ultimate growth as human being.<br />
That said, If he were to hear that today I don&#8217;t know that he&#8217;d agree.<br />
I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d be flattered, but I don&#8217;t know that he&#8217;d buy it.<br />
After all, he was contrary.
