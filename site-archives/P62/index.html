				  <p>	If God gave me the ultimatum  of finding ten righteous people in the parking lot of Trader Joes off of La Brea between 10am and 5pm or him destroying the whole store, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;d have to find someplace else to get my Almond Milk.<br />
	I mean here we have the perfect opportunity to showcase human compassion and cooperation towards one common goalâ€¦parking.&nbsp; All of us need to get groceries and all of us need a spot.&nbsp; With a lot out front, a lot behind the lot out front, a lot across the alleyway, and copious amounts of street parking there is more than enough.&nbsp; If everyone could simply allow the person in front of them to pull out so that they could pull in, let those in back of them go around, and be patient throughout the whole process then all would be copasetic.&nbsp; Unfortunately this is not the case.&nbsp; Rather, the preferred method is honking and creating near collisions as people jockey for position.&nbsp; Granted, this is nowhere near sodomy, murder, or any of the other horrible atrocities of Sodom and Gomorra, but it paints a grim picture for humanity if we can&#8217;t even park together.</p>

<p>At least there&#8217;s a Whole Foods with a covered garage down the street.</p>

<p>Just don&#8217;t look back when you&#8217;re driving away.  </p>
