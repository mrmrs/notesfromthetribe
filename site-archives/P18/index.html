				  <p>To say that I like superheroes is like saying that Ahab was mildly concerned with finding a white whale.</p>

<p>I think &#8216;obsessed&#8217; is the word you&#8217;re looking for.</p>

<p>Yes its true that I couldn&#8217;t get enough comic books…but this fixation was beyond merely reading about them. I wanted to be one.</p>

<p>From the moment I knew how to tie a knot I was wearing a blanket as a cape and running around the house saving my little sister from invisible villains.&nbsp; I used to blow out birthday candles silently wishing for just one power….it didn&#8217;t matter which one…I would even settle for something totally lame like being able to turn a different color or thermoregulating so I was always the perfect body temperature.&nbsp; Sadly nothing materialized and so I started to grow out my finger nails and imagined them as adumantium claws.&nbsp; I would focus on objects and attempt to move them with my mind and every time I jumped off the diving board I imagined for just a second that I was flying.</p>

<p>This was the appeal of Batman.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t have powers like the other characters. He was just a guy. A very rich guy with a dark past who had no social life and unlimited resources. Which really is the only way that a superhero could ever exist in the real world.</p>

<p>But lately I&#8217;ve been wrestling with this idea…I mean suppose for a second that superheroes really did exist.&nbsp; Batman? Superman? The X-Men?&nbsp; What good would these costumed vigilantes really do? It seems that most superheroes spend their time primarily fighting super villains.&nbsp; I mean yes, they also foil the occasional bank robbery and save cats from trees, but even on their best day (when they&#8217;re not causing millions of dollars in property damage with their melees across the city) a superhero simply reestablishes the status quo instead of taking on the real problems of the world.&nbsp;  Poverty, climate change, hunger, global terrorism,corporate greed, government corruption and the list goes on. </p>

<p>Even if these superhuman crusaders existed, the real change would still have to come from the people. </p>

<p>This is what Menachem Mendel Schneerson, The Lubavitcher Rebbe was all about.</p>

<p>For the unacquainted, the Rebbe may just look like another picture of somebody&#8217;s Jewish grandfather on the wall.&nbsp; But for those touched by him and his legacy, he is known as a champion of Jewish outreach to the world, building institutions, advising on political affairs and providing blessings to the sick and needy.<br />
Often lauded as the Messiah, he denied these claims.&nbsp; He was a man, plain and simple.&nbsp; It is for this reason that some Jews adorn their homes and workplaces with his likeness.&nbsp; Whether you believe he is a human being or more, he serves as a reminder of the change we are all capable of bringing to the world without a cape. And that is a true super power.
