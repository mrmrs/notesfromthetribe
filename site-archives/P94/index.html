				  <p>It&#8217;s lunchtime.<br />
Matzah, gefilte fish, and leben. <br />
Again.<br />
Immediately you feel a pair of eyes.<br />
Between bites of his footlong turkey on jalapeno cheddar, your co worker inquires:<br />
&#8216;What is that?&#8217;<br />
&#8216;It&#8217;s fish….sort of….&#8217;<br />
&#8216;No! No! that white cracker thing….&#8217;<br />
You break off a small piece without hesitation and hand it over.<br />
He chews it slowly.<br />
He lights up.<br />
&#8216;Hey! That stuff isn&#8217;t bad!!!&#8217;<br />
Try eating it for eight days, you think.<br />
Then talk to me.
