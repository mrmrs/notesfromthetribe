<p>I feel bad for Jewish vampires.</p>
<p>I mean here they are, constantly surrounded by death, decay and abnormal discharges of body fluid, yet they cannot step foot in a body of running water.</p>
<p>Especially not the holy baths of a mikveh.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t much like crosses either.</p>
<p>I guess the undead must be Buddhists.  </p>
