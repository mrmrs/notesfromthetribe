<p>When I say bagel, you say Jewish.</p>
<p>Bagel.</p>
<p>Jewish.</p>
<p>Although my knee jerk reaction is to be mildly offended whenever somebody attempts to pigeon hole a culture into a baked good, it is admittedly an understandable pairing.</p>
<p>Like peanut butter and jelly or flannel and Hootie and the Blowfish fans.</p>
<p>Its also hard to make an argument against this association when they&#8217;ve been served at literally almost every Jewish function I&#8217;ve been to from my own bris to a brunch at my family&#8217;s house.<br />
  Which would explain why I&#8217;ve been I&#8217;ve been to a Noah&#8217;s Bagels but never a Chang&#8217;s.<br />
  So if the two are in fact synonymous, then I&#8217;m an awfully bad Jew.<br />
  You see, even Jews who skip high holidays love cream cheese.</p>
<p>Not me. <br />
  Can&#8217;t stand the stuff.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m coming clean I might as well express my distaste for  smoked whitefish, capers, kugel, gefilte fish, falafel, cole slaw, charoset, any kind of salad dressing or mayonnaise, matzo balls, tahini sauce, horse radish and anything pickled.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll understand if you need a minute to compose yourself.</p>
<p>So the next time you&#8217;re at an oneg and you see a waifish man in the corner eating a plain bagel and a black and white cookie by himself, come say hi.
