			<p>	
				  <p>When I was in college, my goal was to have so much success outside of academics that I could drop out. <br />
It worked for Brad Pitt, Steve Jobs and Oprah…I thought it could work for me too.<br />
I had a two part plan.<br />
Part one: Find something you&#8217;re passionate about and work really hard for it.<br />
Part two: Forsake nearly all other distractions to achieve your goal. Distractions include but are not limited to late night partying, recreational drug use and of course class.<br />
The first part was fairly easy. I made art and was an actor. I painted constantly and went to auditions on the regular.<br />
The second part proved a bit more difficult. While I couldn&#8217;t completely cut out my social life, I did manage to skip class quite often.<br />
To be clear I didn&#8217;t want to flunk out of college, I wanted to be so wildly successful that I had no other choice but to leave it.<br />
So I still had to study.<br />
Even with two majors this was very manageable.<br />
As an Art major, I just had to keep making the work I was already doing and show up occasionally.<br />
My Interpersonal Communications major mostly required me to know very complex words to very common sense ideas and occasionally write about my feelings with them.<br />
In either case, the syllabus, reading materials and anything else you could need was online or in a textbook. Really the only reason to show up to class was if you were an auditory learner or for the midterm and final.<br />
This made skipping class not only easy, but from a time management perspective, prudent.<br />
I was able to make my life&#8217;s work and still receive high marks.<br />
But after 5 years and two majors, for the sake of tradition, I decided to go to my last week of instruction.&nbsp; <br />
I&#8217;d made it this far and I figured I&#8217;d give it a go.<br />
I even woke up early for the last class I&#8217;d ever take at UCLA.<br />
Communication Studies 116: Counseling Intimate Relationships<br />
Ceremoniously, I put on the outfit I&#8217;d wore to my very first day 5 years before, brought an untouched messenger bag and headed off to class.<br />
I showed up about 10 minutes late, which was early for me.<br />
The room was unusually packed.<br />
There wasn&#8217;t an empty seat in the house.<br />
Hundreds of students hunched over their desks intensely focused on their…scantrons?!?!?!?!<br />
It couldn&#8217;t be.<br />
IT.<br />
COULD.<br />
NOT.<br />
BE.<br />
But it was.<br />
Everything began to blur. <br />
To confirm the nightmare that was unfolding in front of me I conferred with one of the T.A.&#8216;s.<br />
He assured me that had I looked at the syllabus it stated very clearly that the final would happen a week early.<br />
I promptly went outside and vomited in a bush.<br />
There&#8217;s something that happens to reality when blood is pumping so fast to your heart that your brain can&#8217;t keep up.<br />
I marched back inside directly to the professor.<br />
&#8216;I&#8217;m so sorry, I had no idea the final was today. My Grandmother just passed and I just lost track of everything.&#8217;<br />
A side note here. Yes. That is the worst, most cliched excuse in the history of excuses…but my heart goes out to those of you who have actually lost a grandparent at a time when you had to take a final and nobody would believe you.<br />
Not me though. <br />
I was a bold faced, panicked liar that smelled of barf.<br />
And he wasn&#8217;t buying it. &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry to hear about your Grandmother Mr. Deutsch, why don&#8217;t you grab a scantron and we can talk about this later.&#8217;<br />
I borrowed a #2 pencil and laid down in the middle of the lecture hall on my empty stomach.<br />
At least it was multiple choice. <br />
And everybody was fond of making fun of Communications as a &#8216;common sense&#8217; course anyway.<br />
Based on the B+ I got, it turns out they were right.<br />
But the moral of that story has always stuck with me. Had I simply read the supplementary materials closely I would&#8217;ve seen exactly when the final was.<br />
Case in point: ALWAYS read the fine print. </p>

<p>If Jacob had learned this lesson, maybe he wouldn&#8217;t have had to work an extra 7 years.
