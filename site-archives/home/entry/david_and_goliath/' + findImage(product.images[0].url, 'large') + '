			<p>	
				  <p>&nbsp;  &nbsp; This is a story about a boy.&nbsp;  A boy named….Billy….lets say.&nbsp; Billy was a good kid, a sweet kid, a little awkward socially some might say.&nbsp;  But good.&nbsp;  The other children couldn&#8217;t see that good though; they couldn&#8217;t manage to get past his small stature.&nbsp; He was young for his grade and to make matters worse he came from parents whose combined height was still less than eleven feet. To put it bluntly-he was a shrimp.&nbsp;  As it was, Billy had fallen into that most unfortunate situation of social situations…he was at the bottom of the nerd hierarchy.&nbsp; Yes. The nerd hierarchy.&nbsp; Even the unpopular have an elite.&nbsp;  Not only was Billy not cool, but his size made him ripe for being picked on by those who were picked on.&nbsp; In particular their was one overweight classmate who relished mocking him even more than the others. Perhaps it was because of the size differential.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll call this large outcast Chris.&nbsp;  Chris called him munchkin and garden gnome and Billy-bo Baggins.&nbsp;  But no matter how clever the names, they hurt Billy-bo Baggins. They hurt him bad.&nbsp; But Billy had a plan. He wasn&#8217;t going to spend the rest of his life making trips between the bathroom and the water fountain at lunch. He was going places.&nbsp; You see, Billy knew that what he lacked in mass, he made up for in brain power.&nbsp; This would be his revenge.&nbsp;   That Hannukah, Billy received a word of the day calendar. Three hundred and sixty five new phonic weapons to wield. He looked forward to his daily vocabulary lessons, writing each one on a post it note and sticking it on his bathroom mirror.&nbsp; Every morning he would go over this material, drinking in the definitions.&nbsp; And then one day it happened.&nbsp;  He found the perfect word.&nbsp; The word that described Chris in all his heinous, disgusting, revolting, foul, nasty, cruddy, loathly, offensive, wicked, implike, repellent, distasteful, unsporting, putrid and repulsive glory.&nbsp;  He took it to school with him. He carried it in his head hidden behind a sheepish smile and he waited.&nbsp;  First period couldn&#8217;t end soon enough. Billy daydreamed what it would be like for Chris to hear this word, to let the meaning fully sink into that thick head.&nbsp; This would surely prove not only to Chris but to all his classmates that he was indeed their mental superior.&nbsp; Someone to be revered.&nbsp; Admired even.&nbsp; Never again would he face the slings and arrows of their taunts.&nbsp; Today, he would outsmart them. The bell rang for recess.&nbsp; Billy sat where he always sat as the inevitable was soon to occur. Chris lumbered over, a roll of Fruit by the Foot dangling from his mouth.<br />
&#8216;Hey Billy-Bo!&nbsp; It&#8217;s too bad they don&#8217;t make this in your size! They&#8217;d call it Fruit by the Millimeter!&#8217;<br />
Billy smiled. This was it.<br />
&#8216;Chris. You are so REBARBATIVE.&#8217;<br />
Silence. Victory. The fat boy was confused.<br />
&#8216;What did you call me!?!&#8217;<br />
&#8216;I said you&#8217;re REBARBATIVE Chris, you are SO REBARBATIVE.&#8217;<br />
It felt so good to repeat it.<br />
&#8216;You&#8217;re calling me Rubarb-if?&#8217;<br />
&#8216;NO Chris.&nbsp; I&#8217;m calling you REBARBATIVE. DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT REBARBATIVE MEANS?&#8217;<br />
It was obvious he didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; Chris looked around, no help in sight. He had been bested and he was on his own.<br />
That day Billy came home early with a black eye.
