			<p>
				  <p>Jacob wrestled with an angel all evening and at daybreak let him go after his hip was wrenched.&nbsp; For struggling and overcoming both God and man, he was blessed and given the name &#8216;Israel&#8217;.</p>

<p>I had my pants pulled down in second grade by some cruel classmates who wanted to embarrass me during a rainy day assembly.&nbsp; Because the entire school saw, I was given the name &#8216;Little Willy&#8217;.</p>

<p>Sometimes life just isn&#8217;t fair.
