				  <p>There is a place where the archetypal metropolitan Jewish man is not immediately  stereotyped as a cerebral, well read, socially liberal, fiscally gifted, online dating, fashion conscious, slightly balding or semitically afroed, maternally inclined iteration of Woody Allen.</p>

<p>No. </p>

<p>Rather, they are thought of as tanned, toned, gun carrying, smoking but in that sexy foreign way, bred athletically from birth, vertically blessed, chiseled to the point that you could grate cheese on their abdominals, krav maga practicing warriors.</p>

<p>If not, you&#8217;ve seen the pictures tourists bring back.
