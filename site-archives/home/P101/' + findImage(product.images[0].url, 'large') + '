			<p>	
				  <p>As of June 2010, I will have been cursed for 14 years. I’m not sure of the specifics of the initial hex, nor what the shelf life is on a spell of its kind, but I can tell you that it was put on me at the age of 12 during eighth grade by a boy who will remain nameless. His reasoning for going to the extreme of sorcery, as I can understand it best, had to do with a girl in our class who he fancied, and to whom I was romantically linked.&nbsp; Make no mistake; I was not a Don Juan, far from it. The caste system of junior high made it very clear that my prepubescent body and slight lisp were fit for sitting against a wall at lunch and being picked last in P.E.&nbsp; However, a leading role as the Scarecrow in our winter production of “The Wizard of OZ” made my social mobility much more fluid. I began to intermingle with the elite of eighth grade society.&nbsp; So, when the aforementioned girl decided that I was to be her mate, etiquette dictated that I, as the less popular one, had no say in the matter.&nbsp; We were to be boyfriend and girlfriend whether I liked it or not.&nbsp; I was to hold her hand during prospective lunch times in a designated area near the library. It’s not that she wasn’t pretty, she was; Jewish even. But I found the prospect of adolescent dating an altogether terrifying endeavor.&nbsp; I didn’t know what to say to somebody whose interests didn’t include role-playing games, nor was I well-versed in the kissing style of the French.&nbsp; Moreover, I missed my friends terribly. Had the young warlock, with his Doc Marten shoes and Marilyn Manson t-shirt, asked me for her hand I would have gladly given it. For those of you who, up to this point, believe I am using the term ‘curse’ as a euphemism, let me explain that he literally bought a book of spells, recited incantations and informed me in homeroom that he had, in fact, cursed me.&nbsp; My parents did not take this news lightly.&nbsp; My father dabbled in metaphysics, and my mother believed in the clairvoyant power of dreams. Both strongly believed in the power that an evil inclination can have.&nbsp; Rather than reassuring me that things like a curse only hold power to those who believe them, my father gave me a hamsa (the necklace to left of this post) , and my mother advised me to wrap a red band around my arm to protect me from the evil eye. It was too late. The curse had done its work.&nbsp; A week later, the girl in question broke up with me because I refused to sully my tongue in her mouth.&nbsp; I was cursed. And, I was relieved.&nbsp; Since then, things have been looking up for the most part, I’ve had my heart broken a few times, my hair is thinning a little and I occasionally get acid reflux after eating spicy food.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe the curse is wearing off. Maybe after all these years he took it back. I still keep a hamsa in my pocket and a band around my arm, just in case.
