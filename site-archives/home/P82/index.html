				  <p>Any given Saturday night, somebody, somewhere, is dancing to the B-52&#8217;s &#8216;Love Shack&#8217;.<br />
They are wearing some combination of plastic fedora hat, glowsticks, novelty sunglasses, mardi gras beads, and playing an inflatable instrument.<br />
When the song reaches it&#8217;s climax at the bridge, this person will ball up both their hands into fists and pump them into the air chanting &#8216;&#8216;BANG BANG ON THE DOOR BABY!&#8221; So will everyone else around them.<br />
This is no accident. It isn&#8217;t a coincidence. These things don&#8217;t just happen.<br />
He makes it happen. <br />
Not a Rabbi.<br />
Not a Cantor.<br />
But just as important to the success of your simcha.<br />
The MC.</p>
