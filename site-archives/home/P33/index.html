				  <p>Short of forcing every performer to eat Bagels and smoked whitefish on camera, I think one would be hard pressed to find anything that could make the the Chabad &#8216;To Life&#8217; telethon more &#8216;Jewish&#8217;.</p>

<p>The program is well known for its Bearded Hassidic Rabbis in black hats ebulliently dancing to Klezmer in front of a giant tote board and portrait of the Rebbe whilst a cavalcade of celebrities try their best Catskills comedic routine or sing traditional yiddish folk songs. </p>

<p>And all in the name of charity.&nbsp; Over the course of the 31 broadcasts, they&#8217;ve raised millions of dollars for social services that range from education to rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Using their influence to help countless people from all backgrounds.<br />
Like I said, typically Jewish.</p>
