			<p>
				  <p>My first experience with antisemitism at the age of 8 was also my most direct, violent and formative one.<br />
It came in the form of a bright, neon green flyer that my distressed parents had brought home from the local high school and left on the dining room table.<br />
I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.<br />
The text read &#8216;If you&#8217;ve had enough and you&#8217;re ready to kill Jews call this number&#8217;. <br />
There was also a limerick about &#8216;The Jewish Parasite&#8217;, but what struck me was the drawing that accompanied it. <br />
Two beady eyes presided over a long, beaklike nose. <br />
Claws clutched at a money belt that was wrapped around a protruding gut.<br />
Gold chains with Jewish stars spilled forth from a hairy, rodent like chest.<br />
Drool dripped past sharp teeth, curled up into a greedy grin.<br />
It wore a yarmulke.<br />
This wasn&#8217;t just racist, it was specific.<br />
Somebody felt so strongly about me that they took the time to write it, draw it, print it and distribute it. <br />
Their hatred was a labor of love.<br />
I don&#8217;t think I had the awareness to take it personally. <br />
I was mostly confused and intrigued. <br />
I suppose that up to that point I had always thought of myself as just another white person.<br />
Sure, I was a white person who had to take a cooler of Kosher for Passover food to school one week a year but up to that point I had never thought of myself as a minority.<br />
I knew about Egypt, Germany and Russia but to me those were history lessons of a time gone by.<br />
Yet here was clear proof that the threat was still very real.<br />
22 years later, I live in Los Angeles and I&#8217;m surrounded by Jews. <br />
Nobody has ever called me a kike (at least not to my face), or insisted that I&#8217;m Jewing them down.<br />
There is the occasional ignorant person who remarks that I don&#8217;t look Jewish by pointing to my small, button nose but by and large most of my days go by uneventfully as just another male, middle class, college educated, privileged caucasian.<br />
That is until I turn on the news or walk through a metal detector into a Jewish institution and I&#8217;m reminded otherwise.
