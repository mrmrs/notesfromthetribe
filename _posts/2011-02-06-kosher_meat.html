  I have seen the Karate Kid part 3 over 20 times.<br />
  It’s got everything. Strong characters, high stakes, life lessons, romance and bonsai trees. <br />
  The third installment of the trilogy brings the journey of Daniel Laruso full circle as he faces off against the Cobra Kai once and for all. Perhaps my favorite line of the film comes from Terry Silver, owner of the Cobra Kai dojo and the villain of the story.In settling a financial dispute with Mike Barnes, ‘The Bad Boy of Karate’, Terry simply shakes his head and exclaims with a smile: ‘I hope you fight as well as you negotiate!’<br />

  80’s Classic.<br />
  I mentioned this during a conversation I had recently with an older gentleman about American cinema.He was roughly 20 years my senior and surrounded by his wife and family.Upon hearing my penchant for the movie he rolled his eyes and smiled sweetly ‘I get it, you’re in the ironic phase of your life.’<br />
  He was right.<br />
  At the age of 27 very little in my life is as I thought it would be.<br />
  When I was younger I used to believe that wrong and right were clearly defined opposites, that changing the world was incredibly easy, that perfect love existed, and that following your passions were the only things that mattered. I also used to believe in the tooth fairy.I consumed 90’s romantic comedies like ‘Can’t Hardly Wait’ and listened to Savage Garden.I still do. But my context is completely different.This man, this father, this husband explained in between checking his Ipad that he was once in my shoes.However he was now in the ‘expectant’ point in his life, the time where nothing surprised him anymore.Not that he was unhappy, but on the contrary that all was as it had been planned. He really enjoyed ‘Apocalypse Now’.<br />
  I do not know what lies ahead other than that I won’t expect it.<br />
  So for now I’ll enjoy the ironic things.<br />
  Mustaches.<br />
  Bad Films.<br />
