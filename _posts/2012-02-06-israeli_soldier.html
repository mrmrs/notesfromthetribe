  There is a place where the archetypal metropolitan Jewish man is not
  immediately  stereotyped as a cerebral, well read, socially liberal, fiscally
  gifted, online dating, fashion conscious, slightly balding or semitically
  afroed, maternally inclined iteration of Woody Allen.
</p>
<p>
  No.
</p>
<p>
  Rather, they are thought of as tanned, toned, gun carrying, smoking but in
  that sexy foreign way, bred athletically from birth, vertically blessed,
  chiseled to the point that you could grate cheese on their abdominals, krav
  maga practicing warriors.

<p>

</p>

<p>
  If not, you’ve seen the pictures tourists bring back.
