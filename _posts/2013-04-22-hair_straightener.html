<p>
  My Mother recalls the following:
</p>
<p>
  She was going out for an evening of theatre and had dressed accordingly.<br />
  A fancy gown, makeup, perfume and her naturally curly hair coiffed perfectly atop her head.<br />
  A vision to behold.<br />
  Upon entering the theatre a woman stopped her to remark on her appearance.<br />
  ‘Excuse me’ she exclaimed ‘But where did you get that absolutely stunning perm?!’<br />
  My Mother, both surprised and flattered to receive such a compliment in regard to her God-given locks coyly replied ‘Mother Nature’.<br />
  Without hesitation the woman responded ‘Oh, where are they located?’
</p>
