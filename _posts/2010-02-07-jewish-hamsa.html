  As of June 2010, I will have been cursed for 14 years. I’m not sure of the
  specifics of the initial hex, nor what the shelf life is on a spell of its
  kind, but I can tell you that it was put on me at the age of 12 during eighth
  grade by a boy who will remain nameless. His reasoning for going to the
  extreme of sorcery, as I can understand it best, had to do with a girl in our
  class who he fancied, and to whom I was romantically linked.  Make no mistake;
  I was not a Don Juan, far from it. The caste system of junior high made it
  very clear that my prepubescent body and slight lisp were fit for sitting
  against a wall at lunch and being picked last in P.E.  However, a leading role
  as the Scarecrow in our winter production of “The Wizard of OZ” made my social
  mobility much more fluid. I began to intermingle with the elite of eighth
  grade society.  So, when the aforementioned girl decided that I was to be her
  mate, etiquette dictated that I, as the less popular one, had no say in the
  matter.  We were to be boyfriend and girlfriend whether I liked it or not.  I
  was to hold her hand during prospective lunch times in a designated area near
  the library. It’s not that she wasn’t pretty, she was; Jewish even. But I
  found the prospect of adolescent dating an altogether terrifying endeavor.  I
  didn’t know what to say to somebody whose interests didn’t include
  role-playing games, nor was I well-versed in the kissing style of the French.
  Moreover, I missed my friends terribly. Had the young warlock, with his Doc
  Marten shoes and Marilyn Manson t-shirt, asked me for her hand I would have
  gladly given it. For those of you who, up to this point, believe I am using
  the term ‘curse’ as a euphemism, let me explain that he literally bought a
  book of spells, recited incantations and informed me in homeroom that he had,
  in fact, cursed me.  My parents did not take this news lightly.  My father
  dabbled in metaphysics, and my mother believed in the clairvoyant power of
  dreams. Both strongly believed in the power that an evil inclination can have.
  Rather than reassuring me that things like a curse only hold power to those
  who believe them, my father gave me a hamsa (the necklace to left of this
  post) , and my mother advised me to wrap a red band around my arm to protect
  me from the evil eye. It was too late. The curse had done its work.  A week
  later, the girl in question broke up with me because I refused to sully my
  tongue in her mouth.  I was cursed. And, I was relieved.  Since then, things
  have been looking up for the most part, I’ve had my heart broken a few times,
  my hair is thinning a little and I occasionally get acid reflux after eating
  spicy food.  Who knows, maybe the curse is wearing off. Maybe after all these
  years he took it back. I still keep a hamsa in my pocket and a band around my
  arm, just in case.
