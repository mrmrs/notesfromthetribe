  While I have never grown Payot, I know what it is to have Jewish hair.
</p>
<p>
  Indeed, like Jacob I have wrestled with the steadily thinning slightly wavy
  brunette mass of  follicles on top of my head.In spite of my best efforts, it
  refuses to be tamed into any cohesive style. Though over the years I have
  tried (and failed with)the following:
</p>
<p>
  The Butt Cut: Made popular by such 90’s teen heartthrobs as Jonathan Taylor
  Thomas, Devin Sawa, and at one point all three Hanson brothers, this hairdo
  was defined by one straight part down the middle of the scalp that resulted in
  two beautifully symmetrical waves of hair on either side of the face. Often
  the wearer would have to brush a perfectly fallen strand out of their eyes and
  tuck it behind their ear. When properly executed, the look was dreamlike with
  a carefree effortlessness that captured what it meant to be young. On me, the
  left side was flat and the right side was pouffy which made my head look
  lopsided. Apparently I’m not Moses and my scalp is not the Red Sea.
</p>
<p>
  Spikes: Worn by punk bands and Japanese cartoon characters alike, this gravity
  defying look required a fierce amount of control.It was to this end that
  products with names like, ‘glue’, ‘freeze’, ‘hard’, ‘manipulator’, ‘paste’ and
  ‘cement’ were created. The ideal spike was pointy and immobile. The wearer
  looked excitable and rebellious.Mine were soft and curly.I looked sad and
  acquiescent.
</p>
  The ‘Elegantly Disheveled’ look: There is a fine line between artfully looking
  like you don’t care and looking like a complete mess.For example, there is the
  tousled look of a James Franco and the homeless appearance of a late 2000’s
  Joaquin Phoenix. But what separates the two? The answer is intention. While
  the former has shorn his locks into a ‘Devil May Care’ mop, the latter simply
  hasn’t bathed since ‘Gladiator’.I unfortunately seem to vacillate between the
  two based on such factors as lighting, camera angles, atmospheric pressure and
  astrological phenomenon.
</p>
  I may complain it, but at the end of the day, at least I still have it.<br />
  For now.<br />
  Fingers crossed.
