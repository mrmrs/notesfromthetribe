  To me, Havdalah is like water. It takes the form of whatever it’s
  poured into while its composition remains the same. In the kitchen with your
  parents it is one last time for the family to be together before the rest of
  the week begins. In a forest under the stars it is being at one with
  creation. At the conclusion of Yom Kippur it is the final encore of High
  Holidays and another five minutes before the fast is broken. It is the bridge
  between a Holiday and the rest of life. In my adolescence, when I did
  Havdalah mostly at synagogue youth events and summer camp, it was a time for
  me to  get close to the girl I’d been eyeing since Friday night and
  possibly give her a Shavua tov kiss after singing Eliyahu Hanavi.   To give
  you a little background:  From the moment I started salvaging my
  Mother’s copies of Victoria’s Secret out of the recycle, my
  parents made it very clear it to me that if I was going to date a girl under
  their roof, she was going to be Jewish. Of course, living in Orange County
  this simply meant that I wasn’t going to date. There were hardly any
  Jewish girls in my school and the ones that I liked were far out of my
  league. Not to mention it appeared nobody else had been given the same
  guidelines. It seemed that the only opportunity to court, let alone meet
  members of the opposite sex was the small weekend Kinnusim that my
  congregation organized.   During these three day excursions Jewish Teens from
  all over would congregate at one predetermined synagogue to pray, learn, and
  socialize.  So three times a year I was given 72 hours to meet, impress, and
  hopefully smooch a girl. The key to doing so lay in the timing.   Friday Night
  and Saturday morning were devoted to prayer and Sunday was all about the
  Tikkun Olam charity project, so the Saturday post Shabbat activity (usually a
  dance or carnival of some sort) was the small window in which the objective
  could be met.   Havadalah, with the wine, the candle light, soft music, and
  delicious scents was the perfect way to set the tone for the evening. Placing
  oneself in close proximity to the object of affection assured success. Today
  I live in Los Angeles where I’m surrounded by Jews. Havdalah has taken
  it’s place as one last welcome breath before the end of the Sabbath.
  These days when I want to impress a lady, all I need is a Vanilla scented
  Glade plug in and a little Josh Groben.
