<p class="lh-copy measure">
  After years of watching, leading and participating in horahs I have come up
  with the following formula to calculate the potential risks of such an
  endeavor:
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  (Flailing Of Person On Chair Due To Nervousness+Chiropractic Issues of People
  Holding The Chair+Inebriation Of Guests)÷(Height Of Ceiling+Structural
  Integrity of Chair+Upper Body Strength And Endurance)=Probability of Injury
  due to falling off chair and/or hitting ones head.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  All things considered, its amazing that most simchas don’t end with a trip to
  the E.R.
