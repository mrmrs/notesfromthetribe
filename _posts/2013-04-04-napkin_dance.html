				  <p>After years of watching, leading and participating in horahs I have come up with the following formula to calculate the potential risks of such an endeavor:</p>

<p><br />
(Flailing Of Person On Chair Due To Nervousness+Chiropractic Issues of People Holding The Chair+Inebriation Of Guests)รท(Height Of Ceiling+Structural Integrity of Chair+Upper Body Strength And Endurance)=Probability of Injury due to falling off chair and/or hitting ones head.</p>

<p>All things considered, its amazing that most simchas don&#8217;t end with a trip to the E.R.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
