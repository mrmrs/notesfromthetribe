<p>
  My brother was wrongfully accused of attempting to murder me at the age of five.<br />
  I publicly state in writing that this was not the case.<br />
  Rather, it was an unintentional botched suicide.<br />
  The kind of unwitting act that young children perform everyday by sticking
  their fingers too close to an electrical outlet or running for a ball in the
  middle of the street.<br />
  I wanted to grab a  giant, golden, crunchy maple leaf that was floating in a fountain.<br />
  My brother and I leaned against the edge watching it circle endlessly.<br />
  I lunged for it and fell in.<br />
  I regained consciousness in the back of our station wagon.<br />
  I was wrapped in a warm blanket whilst my brother was coldly convicted.<br />
  Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure there are times my brother would’ve loved to kill me.<br />
  But I tell you now, I was not pushed.<br />
  I’m sure that helps 22 years later, Edward.<br />
  Sorry.
