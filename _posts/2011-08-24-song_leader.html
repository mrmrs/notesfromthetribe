<p>
  I will openly admit to the fact that I know all the words to Peter, Paul and
  Mary’s version of ‘Leaving on a Jet Plane.’
</p>
<p>
  I am not ashamed to say that I have belted out these lyrics countless times,
  letting their intended meaning wash over me as I’ve embraced my closest
  friends and told them to ‘kiss me and smile for me.’
</p>
<p>
  On occasion I’ve even held out my arms like the wings of an aircraft and run
  around frantically mimicking a flight pattern.
</p>
<p>
  To an outsider this must look strange.<br />
  A bunch of kids in birkenstocks and flip flops in a circle crying and singing Simon and Garfunkel/ Edie Berkel/Carly Simon/Dave Matthews Band/Bob Marley/Debbie Friedman/James Taylor tunes.<br />
  But for us it’s the last day of camp.
