				  <p>I will openly admit to the fact that I know all the words to Peter, Paul and Mary's version of &#8216;Leaving on a Jet Plane.' <br />
I am not ashamed to say that I have belted out these lyrics countless times, letting their intended meaning wash over me as I've embraced my closest friends and told them to &#8216;kiss me and smile for me.'<br />
On occasion I've even held out my arms like the wings of an aircraft and run around frantically mimicking a flight pattern.<br />
To an outsider this must look strange.<br />
A bunch of kids in birkenstocks and flip flops in a circle crying and singing Simon and Garfunkel/ Edie Berkel/Carly Simon/Dave Matthews Band/Bob Marley/Debbie Friedman/James Taylor tunes.<br />
But for us it's the last day of camp.
