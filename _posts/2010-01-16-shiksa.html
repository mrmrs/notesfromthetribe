  The gorgeous goyim. The gentle gentile. The buxom blonde haired blue eyed
  breaker of mothers hearts. They are the awkward subject change following the
  inevitable question “are they Jewish?” and considered a perfectly viable mate
  in every way were it not for the fact they aren’t. When brought into a Jewish
  community these individuals are met with at least one the following responses:
</p>
<p>
  1)Denial: This is a tactic commonly used when the non Jew in question has not
  been met face to face. If said person is mentioned at all, it is done in an
  amiable fashion.  The denial may take the form of not recognizing the status
  of the relationship with such questions as ‘oh is your friend coming to
  dinner?’ and ‘how is that friend of yours?’. In addition they may also neglect
  religious background with the queries such as: “what is your friend doing for
  Rosh Hashanah?”  Sometimes the significant other is omitted altogether with
  offers of a setup with a ‘nice Jewish girl.’
</p>
<p>
  2)Anger: The most direct response. Made mostly with cries of assimilation and
  the destruction of the Jewish people.
</p>
<p>
  3)Bargaining: Bargaining invariably takes the form of the following flow
  chart:
</p>
<p>
  IS HE/SHE JEWISH?[yes]GOOD!<br>
  [no]<br>
  WILL HE/SHE CONVERT?[yes]GOOD!<br>
  [no]<br>
  WILL THE CHILDREN BE RAISED JEWISH?[yes]OK…THAT WILL DO<br>
  [no]<br>
  USE ANOTHER RESPONSE
</p>
<p>
  4)Depression: A fine blend of acceptance and anger, but in a much more passive sense. The beau is included in all family activities but with a tinge of melancholy.  Phrases such as “such a nice girl, if only she was Jewish” may be uttered.  If a sibling with a Jewish mate is present, both couples are subtly compared and contrasted.  Note: if a sibling is not present, a relative or close family friend may serve as an adequate substitute.
</p>
<p>
  5)Acceptance: A Christmas tree on Hanukkah and an extra guest at the Seder table.
</p>
<p>
  Admittedly, it’s a touchy subject for everyone involved. Bringing home someone
  to meet the family is hard enough, especially when even the most casual of
  flirtations has the weight of marriage, grandchildren, and the fate of Judaism
  itself attached.  That said, the important thing to remember is that regardless
  of reaction, at the heart of all this is love.  The love that only a Jewish
  parent could show.
