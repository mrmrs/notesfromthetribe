				  <p>Amanda liked Morrissey, so I liked Morrisey too.<br />
Or at least I told her I did.<br />
The lie began as harmless banter on our first date.<br />
She told me how much she loved the Smiths and I casually agreed they were &#8216;great'.<br />
&#8216;Really?! You're a fan!?' She responded excitedly. <br />
Seeing as how I'd been called out and how thrilled she was, it seemed only natural to affirm my opinion. &#8216;OhYeah! They're awesome!'<br />
&#8216;Well which song is your favorite?' she beamed.<br />
&#8216;Uh, man they're all so good. Its just the sincerity of the performance you know?' It was a diplomatic choice.<br />
&#8216;I know right!?! But the way he asks &#8216;Why do you come here?' In Suedehead just breaks my heart every time. I love it.'She clutched her chest as she imagined hearing it.<br />
I nodded in agreement and quickly changed the subject.<br />
6 dates later she greeted me with a C.D. labeled &#8216;Amanda's Super Awesome Song Mix'.Hearts and lightning bolts drawn in sharpie adorned its surface.<br />
We got in my car and she slid it into the player. &#8216;Turn it to number 5.' She said with a knowing grin.<br />
A warbled Irish Falsetto began pouring out of the speakers as I stared in horror at the sight of her singing every word of &#8216;Every Day is Like Sunday' and motioning for me to do the same.<br />
I panicked and began mumbling something between lyrics and a low hum. Amanda was engrossed and didn't seem to notice.<br />
It went on like this for weeks. More mixes. More songs I'd never heard and pretended to love.<br />
Then came my birthday.<br />
I wanted to go camping with my friends. Amanda hated camping and my friends. Besides, she had other plans for us.<br />
Two tickets to Morrissey live at the L.A. Sports Arena.<br />
It was like opening an ill fitting hand knit sweater in front of my Grandmother.<br />
&#8216;I can't wait!' I said a little too enthusiastically.<br />
The concert was two weeks away and I knew about 3 songs. I was going to have to do some serious homework. <br />
I went on the forums and after reading up on his discography, purchased &#8216;Southpaw Grammar' and &#8216;Viva Hate' on vinyl.<br />
I knew 20 songs and a slew of wikipedia facts well enough to get through one evening. <br />
In a 2 hour set he played roughly 4 of them.<br />
During the others I was left bobbing my head, waiting until the chorus to chime in.<br />
I think it had become apparent to my lady friend that I had used the term &#8216;fan' loosely.<br />
We broke up a few months later.<br />
The music was just a part of it. A symptom of something larger.<br />
It was the person that I was around her, or rather the person that I wasn't.<br />
She was serious so I was serious too.<br />
She liked drinking all the time so I became a lush. <br />
She didn't like that I spent so much time on my art so I spent less time drawing.<br />
You get the picture.<br />
I didn't recognize myself.<br />
But let me be clear here: the fault was completely mine.<br />
I allowed myself to give up all the things that made me strong because I was taken with a pretty face.<br />
This is a theme as old as any love song about a woman ever written.<br />
In fact, the Smiths wrote one called &#8216;Wonderful Woman'. <br />
Its actually kind of nice.
