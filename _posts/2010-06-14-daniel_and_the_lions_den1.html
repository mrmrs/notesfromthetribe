<p>
  I run the risk of throwing myself into the lions den every time I open my
  mouth. There are those people that have a hard time connecting their thoughts
  to the words they say. I am not one of those people. If anything, my problem
  is not a lack of awareness, but an inundation of it. At the heart of any
  interaction, I have a single driving purpose: I desperately want you to like
  me. Tell me I’m funny, tell me i’m creative and original, marvel
  at the fact that I pack my sentences full of unnecessarily long words. It
  may be self loathing but it’s true. Yet sometimes I find myself
  offending the very people I’m trying to win over. I think the root of
  the problem is genetic. I have inherited my european mothers very thick,
  perfectly arched eyebrows. They are often furrowed, and on me, look somewhat
  villainous in nature. In fact, the upper portion of my face with it’s
  broken capillaries and prognathic brow looks like it was meant for someone
  far more physical then myself, a soldier or a boxer perhaps. When resting I
  appear lost in pensive anger. To make matters worse, I have my fathers mouth,
  with lips that curve upward revealing a dimple on my left side. When both the
  maternal and paternal halves meet to make an utterance, the result is a
  smirk. Then there’s my voice. I have a British intonation from my
  mother, which when used with an English accent is seen by American’s as
  both charming and witty (case in point: Hugh Grant, who cheated on his
  beautiful girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley with a prostitute and yet years later
  is still melting American audiences in movies like ‘Love
  Actually’ and ‘Music and Lyrics’). However, with an
  American accent it comes off as condescending with a hint of sexual
  ambiguity. So to review, whenever I say anything at all I am doing so with
  both a smirk and snooty delivery. Combine this with the fact that I have an
  overactive vocabulary and I can’t say something as simple as:
  ‘That meal was an absolute culinary cornucopia of confections’
  without seeming sarcastic and judgmental. Moreover, I actually am sarcastic
  and judgmental which makes not seeming so twice as hard. Believe me
  I’ve tried different approaches. Showering a stranger with compliments
  only makes you seem more desperate and addressing the fact that some people
  perceive you negatively only exacerbates the problem. So for now I’ve
  taken to wearing fake glasses when I want to make a good impression, and
  writing my thoughts down on a website each week where people don’t have
  to see me speak and I can edit my words.
