  I run the risk of throwing myself into the lions den every time I open my
  mouth. There are those people that have a hard time connecting their thoughts
  to the words they say. I am not one of those people.& If anything, my problem
  is not a lack of awareness, but an inundation of it. At the heart of any
  interaction, I have a single driving purpose: I desperately want you to like
  me. Tell me I&#8217;m funny, tell me i&#8217;m creative and original, marvel
  at the fact that I pack my sentences full of unnecessarily long words. It
  may be self loathing but it&#8217;s true. Yet sometimes I find myself
  offending the very people I&#8217;m trying to win over. I think the root of
  the problem is genetic.& I have inherited my european mothers very thick,
  perfectly arched eyebrows.& They are often furrowed, and on me, look somewhat
  villainous in nature. In fact, the upper portion of my face with it&#8217;s
  broken capillaries and prognathic brow looks like it was meant for someone
  far more physical then myself, a soldier or a boxer perhaps.& When resting I
  appear lost in pensive anger. To make matters worse, I have my fathers mouth,
  with lips that curve upward revealing a dimple on my left side. When both the
  maternal and paternal halves meet to make an utterance, the result is a
  smirk. Then there&#8217;s my voice. I have a British intonation from my
  mother, which when used with an English accent is seen by American&#8217;s as
  both charming and witty (case in point: Hugh Grant, who cheated on his
  beautiful girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley with a prostitute and yet years later
  is still melting American audiences in movies like &#8216;Love
  Actually&#8217; and &#8216;Music and Lyrics&#8217;). However, with an
  American accent it comes off as condescending with a hint of sexual
  ambiguity. So to review, whenever I say anything at all I am doing so with
  both a smirk and snooty delivery. Combine this with the fact that I have an
  overactive vocabulary and I can&#8217;t say something as simple as:
  &#8216;That meal was an absolute culinary cornucopia of confections&#8217;
  without seeming sarcastic and judgmental. Moreover, I actually am sarcastic
  and judgmental which makes not seeming so twice as hard. Believe me
  I&#8217;ve tried different approaches. Showering a stranger with compliments
  only makes you seem more desperate and addressing the fact that some people
  perceive you negatively only exacerbates the problem. So for now I&#8217;ve
  taken to wearing fake glasses when I want to make a good impression, and
  writing my thoughts down on a website each week where people don&#8217;t have
  to see me speak and I can edit my words.
