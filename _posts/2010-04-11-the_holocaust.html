				  <p>For me, &#8216;Never forget&#8217; is easy.</p>

<p>&#8216;Never again&#8217; is hard.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not ignorant. Through pictures, films, books, classes, museums, trips to the scenes of great atrocities, I have borne witness and made a promise with my generation to &#8216;never forget&#8217; so that the world may forever remember the horror of the Holocaust long after the last survivor passes.&nbsp; And though I  say &#8216;never again&#8217;, it happens. Again and again. Almost 65 years later and people on this planet are still systematically oppressed and murdered. While these acts may not hold a candle to the 6,000,000 executed, it is a wake up call to the evil that men can still do.&nbsp; And for whatever reason, I do nothing.&nbsp; Short of a parable about a grain of sand changing the beach, I&#8217;m not sure that any of my actions create any real lasting change in the world. But I do know there are people whose actions do. Which is why I support them.&nbsp; Hence, a portion of the proceeds from this weeks prints will go to the Simon Weisenthal Center dedicated to &#8220;Confronting antisemitism, hate and terrorism, promoting human rights and dignity, standing with Israel, defending the safety of Jews worldwide, and teaching the lessons of the Holocaust for future generations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Never forget.  </p>
