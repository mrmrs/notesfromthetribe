  For me, ‘Never forget’ is easy.

<p class="lh-copy measure">
  ‘Never again’ is hard.

<p class="lh-copy measure">
  I’m not ignorant. Through pictures, films, books, classes, museums,
  trips to the scenes of great atrocities, I have borne witness and made a
  promise with my generation to ‘never forget’ so that the world
  may forever remember the horror of the Holocaust long after the last survivor
  passes. And though I  say ‘never again’, it happens. Again and
  again. Almost 65 years later and people on this planet are still
  systematically oppressed and murdered. While these acts may not hold a candle
  to the 6,000,000 executed, it is a wake up call to the evil that men can
  still do. And for whatever reason, I do nothing. Short of a parable about a
  grain of sand changing the beach, I’m not sure that any of my actions
  create any real lasting change in the world. But I do know there are people
  whose actions do. Which is why I support them. Hence, a portion of the
  proceeds from this weeks prints will go to the Simon Weisenthal Center
  dedicated to “Confronting antisemitism, hate and terrorism, promoting
  human rights and dignity, standing with Israel, defending the safety of Jews
  worldwide, and teaching the lessons of the Holocaust for future
  generations. ”
