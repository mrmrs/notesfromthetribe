<p>
  For me, &#8216;Never forget&#8217; is easy.
</p>

<p>
  &#8216;Never again&#8217; is hard.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;m not ignorant. Through pictures, films, books, classes, museums,
  trips to the scenes of great atrocities, I have borne witness and made a
  promise with my generation to &#8216;never forget&#8217; so that the world
  may forever remember the horror of the Holocaust long after the last survivor
  passes.& And though I  say &#8216;never again&#8217;, it happens. Again and
  again. Almost 65 years later and people on this planet are still
  systematically oppressed and murdered. While these acts may not hold a candle
  to the 6,000,000 executed, it is a wake up call to the evil that men can
  still do.& And for whatever reason, I do nothing.& Short of a parable about a
  grain of sand changing the beach, I&#8217;m not sure that any of my actions
  create any real lasting change in the world. But I do know there are people
  whose actions do. Which is why I support them.& Hence, a portion of the
  proceeds from this weeks prints will go to the Simon Weisenthal Center
  dedicated to &#8220;Confronting antisemitism, hate and terrorism, promoting
  human rights and dignity, standing with Israel, defending the safety of Jews
  worldwide, and teaching the lessons of the Holocaust for future
  generations.&#8221;
</p>

<p>Never forget.</p>
