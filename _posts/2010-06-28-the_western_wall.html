  For Jews, the Western Wall is arguably the holiest spot on the planet. It is
  the last remnant of the second temple, and tangible evidence of God's
  promise that it &#8220;would never be destroyed&#8221;.Every year, millions
  make pilgrimage to the wall to pray in it's presence.Despite
  it's importance it has earned only one nickname from gentiles over the
  years: The Wailing Wall. This is of course in reference to both what is
  interpreted as the sorrowful devotional prayer of jews at the wall and
  recognition of the site as a place of mourning the temple's
  destruction.Though this name is in many ways apropos, it is a bit glum. So
  I thought that I might offer my two cents as to some alternatives that might
  pep it up a bit.In addition, with the recent dip in tourism to Israel,
  these ideas might make the wall more of a hotspot.

  1)The Great Wall of Israel: China's got one.2)The Western Wall-3D:
  Too long has this art form been confined to overpriced animated Pixar
  features. As soon as a visitor enters the old city, they are given a pair of
  glasses. Not only does it attract a new audience, but the slogan &#8216;See
  the Kotel for the first timeâ€¦.again' brings back the old one.  3)
  Wild Wild Western Wall: Perhaps this involves some sort of Vegas style stage
  show that happens at various times during the day (excluding Shabbat). The
  story would loosely incorporate the Jewish-Roman war but with cowboys and
  indians.Pyrotechnics and audience participation is a must.Tagline:
  &#8216;Where the Wild West Meets the Middle East!'4) Disney Wall:
  This is a win/win partnership. Walt gets to make amends for his inflammatory
  behavior in the 1940s and Israel gets the benefits of one of the most
  powerful names in the world.The sales of Mickey mouse eared yarmulkes would
  skyrocket.5)The Wishing Wall: Millions of people write down their prayers
  on a piece of paper each year and put them in the wall. Imagine if they did
  it with currency.6)The Western Facebook Wall: I'm honestly not quite
  sure how this one would work but I do know that the play on words and the
  popularity of Facebook make it necessary.

  Obviously my ideas are genius. They would bring more tourism and money than
  ever before to a region of the world that needs it. However, the fact they are
  not used (nor would they even be seriously considered) points to what is really
  important about this place.It is not a tourist trap. Since the destruction of
  the Temple in 70CE, Jews have been spread to every corner of the globe.But
  during the silent Amidah we turn towards Jerusalem.After all these years,
  this site remains the spiritual center of Judaism.It's presence is a
  physical reminder of where we came from as a people, and that much like the
  wall we are still standing.
