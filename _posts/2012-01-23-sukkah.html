<p>According to Ariela Pelaia, professional Jewish Educator and &#8216;Judaism Guide&#8217; on About.com: </p>
<p>&#8216;A sukkah usually has at least two and a half sides, which can be constructed of any material so long as the sides are secure and don&#8217;t flap in the wind. The roof must be made of natural, unprocessed materials that have grown in the ground - such as tree branches, bamboo poles or even wood that&#8217;s been shaped into planks. In addition, the roof should be left open so that people inside the sukkah can see the sky.&#8217;</p>

This also describes at least half of the apartments I&#8217;ve rented in Los Angeles.<br />
At least they were rent controlled&#8230;..
