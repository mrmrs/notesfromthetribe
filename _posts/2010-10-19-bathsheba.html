				  <p>&nbsp;   If it is absolute truth you seek, look no farther than your radio dial and the lyrics of a pop song. The trite wordplay of the latest hit speaks volumes. The words are cliche and the message is obvious.&nbsp; And why is it obvious? Because it is true.&nbsp; This is content whose veracity has stood the test of time and become mundane through it&#8217;s repetition. Perfect stuff for a hook.&nbsp; Nobody ever listens to the words, but the modern day prophets of top 40 music have somehow managed to unlock the DNA of our reality.<br />
Breaking up actually is hard to do.<br />
At the end of the day, whether it&#8217;s a serious commitment or a one night thing, girls want to have fun.<br />
Father should be good to their daughters.<br />
If you want to make a change you have to start with the man in the mirror.<br />
The first cut is the deepest.<br />
It ain&#8217;t about what&#8217;s waiting on the other side, it&#8217;s the climb.<br />
Some men like big butts….and they refuse to prevaricate.<br />
More money can lead to more problems-simplify.<br />
Women do not like &#8216;scrubs&#8217; or any guy hanging out the side of his best friends ride.<br />
Sometimes we all could &#8216;use somebody&#8217;<br />
You can&#8217;t read a pokerface.<br />
Nobody wants to be an American idiot.<br />
You&#8217;ve gotta have faith….faith…a…faith..a faith.<br />
And so on.<br />
If only Uriah had been able to listen to the wise warning of Jimmy Soul&#8217;s 1963 classic before marrying Bathsheba: &#8220;If you want to be happy for the rest of your life, never make a pretty woman your wife. So from my personal point of view get an ugly girl to marry you.&#8221;&nbsp; It probably would have worked out better for him.
