  If it is absolute truth you seek, look no farther than your radio dial and
  the lyrics of a pop song. The trite wordplay of the latest hit speaks
  volumes. The words are cliche and the message is obvious.And why is it
  obvious? Because it is true.This is content whose veracity has stood the
  test of time and become mundane through it's repetition. Perfect stuff
  for a hook.Nobody ever listens to the words, but the modern day prophets of
  top 40 music have somehow managed to unlock the DNA of our reality.

  Breaking up actually is hard to do.<br />
  At the end of the day, whether it's a serious commitment or a one night thing, girls want to have fun.<br />
  Father should be good to their daughters.<br />
  If you want to make a change you have to start with the man in the mirror.<br />
  The first cut is the deepest.<br />
  It ain't about what's waiting on the other side, it's the climb.<br />
  Some men like big butts….and they refuse to prevaricate.<br />
  More money can lead to more problems-simplify.<br />
  Women do not like &#8216;scrubs' or any guy hanging out the side of his best friends ride.<br />
  Sometimes we all could &#8216;use somebody'<br />
  You can't read a pokerface.<br />
  Nobody wants to be an American idiot.<br />
  You've gotta have faith….faith…a…faith..a faith.<br />
  And so on.<br />
  If only Uriah had been able to listen to the wise warning of Jimmy
  Soul's 1963 classic before marrying Bathsheba: &#8220;If you want to be
  happy for the rest of your life, never make a pretty woman your wife. So from
  my personal point of view get an ugly girl to marry you.&#8221;It probably
  would have worked out better for him.
