  I&#8217;m not even sure I&#8217;m losing my hair. <br /> I started my anti
  balding treatment when I was 19 at the urging of my stylist. Almost every man
  in my family has lost his mop, so I thought it better to be safe than sorry.
  It&#8217;s preventative really. I shampoo and condition everyday with a
  steady regimen of vitamins and scalp stimulators.  I also make it a point to
  avoid red meat and have lots of raw almonds on hand. The problem, however, is
  that I can&#8217;t tell if it&#8217;s working or I&#8217;m actually just not
  balding, but I&#8217;m too afraid to stop.   The hardest part is waiting for
  it to fall out.  At what point do I stop evasive measures and begin with
  aggressive maneuvers? I&#8217;ve found myself sizing up other guys’ scalps.
  Every morning, I mentally note the tresses left on my pillow. Each one is a
  reminder that sooner or later I&#8217;m going to have to deal with it.
  Luckily, I have a three-phase plan: In phase one, if I begin to bald around
  the crown area, I will wear progressively larger yarmulkes to cover the spot.
  I&#8217;ve seen this method work with varying levels of success. Should the
  peninsula of a hairline on my ever enlarging forehead recede all the way
  back, I will begin phase two.   I call this the ‘hat phase&#8217; or the
  &#8216;Ron Howard phase,&#8217; for those of you who are familiar. This
  involves growing out what remains of my locks so as to give the appearance of
  a thick mane when a hat is carefully positioned.  Headware will be rotated on
  a regular basis and according to the social situation.  Given my artist
  lifestyle, no one will think twice of my eclectic wardrobe. And if they do, I
  will initiate the third and final phase— shaving it all off. Before I do, I
  will have to double up on cardio and free weights, tan religiously, grow a
  small &#8216;soul patch&#8217;, buy some snazzy new vests, work spicy foods
  into my diet and develop a slight unplaced accent. The goal of this is, of
  course, to make myself ambiguously foreign. That way, buzzing it will seem
  more like a style choice than a product of male pattern baldness. It worked
  for Howie Mandel and it can work for me too.
