				  <p>As a child, I believed that all Christians were chumps.<br />
Growing up in Orange County this meant that a LOT of my classmates fell into this category.<br />
After all, these were rational human beings with healthy, developing brains that still gave credence to the notion that once a year, a man in a fur lined suit circumnavigated the globe in a sleigh powered by flying reindeer and touched down in every home leaving presents for good little girls and boys.<br />
All physics aside, this theory still had gaping holes.<br />
Why did rich kids get more presents than poor kids?<br />
How does a complete stranger know your shoe size?<br />
Isn't that the same guy riding a giant electric shaver in those Circuit City commercials?<br />
ELVES!?!??!<br />
Clearly these poor simpletons had been duped.As the token Jew at my Montessori preschool I made it my business to let them know.I was of course promptly set aside and told that I wasn't about to be the one who showed these fools the man behind the curtain.<br />
Imagine my dismay when years later, whilst snooping through my mother's things I happened upon a clear plastic box filled with human teeth.<br />
It was labeled &#8216;William.' <br />
Right next to it was another one filled with even more teeth.<br />
It was labeled &#8216;Edward.'<br />
This couldn't be happening. I was sure my Mother would have a reasonable explanation.I needed answers.<br />
&#8216;Is the Toothfairy real?' I asked.<br />
She smiled and looked me directly in the eye &#8216;What do you think?'<br />
&#8216;I'm worried it might not be……I mean….No….No I don't think it is…..I found a box of my teeth….'I admitted. <br />
Then I cried. <br />
Was this really possible?Was I no better off then the yuletide celebrating schmucks I so pitied?<br />
Moreover, what else had I been lied to about?<br />
I think about this every Passover, when we send a child to open up the door for Elijah and take turns sipping from a cup of wine.
