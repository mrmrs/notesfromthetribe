<p class="lh-copy measure">As a child, I believed that all Christians were chumps. <br />
  Growing up in Orange County this meant that a LOT of my classmates fell into this category. <br />
  After all, these were rational human beings with healthy, developing brains that still gave credence to the notion that once a year, a man in a fur lined suit circumnavigated the globe in a sleigh powered by flying reindeer and touched down in every home leaving presents for good little girls and boys. <br />
  All physics aside, this theory still had gaping holes. <br />
  Why did rich kids get more presents than poor kids?<br />
  How does a complete stranger know your shoe size?<br />
  Isn’t that the same guy riding a giant electric shaver in those Circuit City commercials?<br />
  ELVES!?!??!<br />
  Clearly these poor simpletons had been duped. As the token Jew at my Montessori preschool I made it my business to let them know. I was of course promptly set aside and told that I wasn’t about to be the one who showed these fools the man behind the curtain. <br />
  Imagine my dismay when years later, whilst snooping through my mother’s things I happened upon a clear plastic box filled with human teeth. <br />
  It was labeled ‘William. ’ <br />
  Right next to it was another one filled with even more teeth. <br />
  It was labeled ‘Edward. ’<br />
  This couldn’t be happening. I was sure my Mother would have a reasonable explanation. I needed answers. <br />
  ‘Is the Toothfairy real?’ I asked. <br />
  She smiled and looked me directly in the eye ‘What do you think?’<br />
  ‘I’m worried it might not be……I mean…. No…. No I don’t think it is…. . I found a box of my teeth…. ’I admitted. <br />
  Then I cried. <br />
  Was this really possible?Was I no better off then the yuletide celebrating schmucks I so pitied?<br />
  Moreover, what else had I been lied to about?<br />
  I think about this every Passover, when we send a child to open up the door for Elijah and take turns sipping from a cup of wine.
