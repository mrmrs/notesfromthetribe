  I kind of get where Joseph’s brothers are coming from. I’m just
  saying that, from what I can tell, Joseph seems annoyingly perfect.
</p>
<p>
  I mean, the guy was thrown into a pit, left for dead, sold into slavery twice
  over and jailed for NOT sleeping with his boss’s wife. When he finally
  overcame tragedy and was given the chance to exact his revenge, he played a
  practical joke on his brothers with a sack of wheat and a goblet, but then
  accepted them with open arms into the kingdom of Egypt.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe I’m a hater, but that is one brown-nosing goody two-shoes,
  apple-polishing boy scout.
</p>
<p>
  Joseph is like that honor roll varsity athlete with a letterman jacket that
  you hated in high school, despite the fact that if you had talked to him he
  was probably the sweetest guy ever. He’s one of those guys
  that’s so genuinely kind he doesn’t even understand the concept
  of sarcasm, and with the kind of perfection that makes you hate yourself for
  being such a bastard.
</p>
<p>
  To illustrate, I have constructed a dialogue that might have actually
  occurred between Joseph and I, were he alive today:
</p>
<p>
  Joseph: Hey Will, you seem pretty down…are you alright?
</p>
<p>
  Will: Yeah, I’ve just had a rough week. I got a parking ticket.
</p>
<p>
  J: Oh, I understand. You know, I felt the same way during my prison sentence
  in Egypt after the cupbearer I helped reinstate didn’t come to my aid
  and release me. Do you want a massage buddy?
</p>
<p>
  W: No thanks…
</p>
<p>
  See what I mean?The guy had it coming. <br /> The moral of the story is
  this: Nobody likes a teachers pet…except for Jacob, Potiphar,
  Potiphar’s wife, Pharaoh and, apparently, God.
