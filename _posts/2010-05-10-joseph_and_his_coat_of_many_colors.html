				  <p>I kind of get where Joseph&#8217;s brothers are coming from.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just saying that, from what I can tell, Joseph seems annoyingly perfect. <br />

I mean, the guy was thrown into a pit, left for dead, sold into slavery twice over and jailed for NOT sleeping with his boss&#8217;s wife.&nbsp; When he finally overcame tragedy and was given the chance to exact his revenge, he played a practical joke on his brothers with a sack of wheat and a goblet, but then accepted them with open arms into the kingdom of Egypt.&nbsp; <br />

Maybe I&#8217;m a hater, but that is one brown-nosing goody two-shoes, apple-polishing boy scout.<br />

Joseph is like that honor roll varsity athlete with a letterman jacket that you hated in high school, despite the fact that if you had talked to him he was probably the sweetest guy ever.&nbsp; He&#8217;s one of those guys that&#8217;s so genuinely kind he doesn&#8217;t even understand the concept of sarcasm,&nbsp; and with the kind of perfection that makes you hate yourself for being such a bastard. <br />

To illustrate, I have constructed a dialogue that might have actually occurred between Joseph and I, were he alive today:<br />

Joseph: Hey Will, you seem pretty down…are you alright?<br />

Will: Yeah, I&#8217;ve just had a rough week.&nbsp; I got a parking ticket. <br />

J: Oh, I understand.&nbsp; You know, I felt the same way during my prison sentence in Egypt after the cupbearer I helped reinstate didn&#8217;t come to my aid and release me.&nbsp; Do you want a massage buddy?<br />

W: No thanks&#8230;.. <br />

See what I mean?&nbsp; The guy had it coming.<br />
The moral of the story is this: Nobody likes a teachers pet…except for Jacob, Potiphar, Potiphar&#8217;s wife, Pharaoh and, apparently, God.
