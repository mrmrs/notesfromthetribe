<p class="lh-copy measure">
  My mother had already decided long before I was born that our family was
  going to be Jewish whether we liked it or not. This, of course, meant wearing
  a clip-on tie and sitting beside my father and brother on Saturday mornings
  while I attempted not to fidget for a good three to four hours. Having been
  raised in the Hassidic tradition, my brother took well to davening. However,
  based on the Weinerschnitzel wrappers I found in his car, and the fact that
  he read Hebrew at a first grade level, I got the sense that my father was
  going along with my mother’s wishes and having just as hard a time as I
  was. Being as a five-year-old doesn’t have meditative discipline, I
  found that the key to getting through Shabbat services was distraction.
  Luckily, my father had incredibly fat hands. I was never that close in
  proximity to them during the rest of the week, but on Saturday mornings they
  were the nearest thing to a cartoon that I was going to get. When my parents
  were first married, my father was a skinny man, roughly 135 pounds and 5 feet
  5 inches tall, no bigger than I am now. He had a love affair with food, but
  an active lifestyle to match his appetite. With the complacency of matrimony
  he became tired and stationary, and so grew while his wedding ring remained
  the same size. The result, in comparison to watching people read Torah, was
  fascinating. Here were these five overgrown sausages jutting forth from his
  palm, and wrapped tightly in between his index and pinky finger was a band of
  metal that seemed to suffocate his knuckle. Either out of distraction or
  sympathy he let me play with it. I would often work the ring back and forth
  sliding it off his finger to reveal the clammy white indentation left
  beneath. A few wiry black hairs stood out in contrast to the grotesque
  fleshiness. “Why does it look like that?” I would ask. “Because I never
  take it off,” he replied. “Does it hurt?” He would slide the ring back
  on,“No.” The same was true of the watch he wore on his wrist. It occurs to
  me that avoiding Saturday morning services may have been his entire reason
  for putting me into a youth soccer league and coaching my team later on. It
  certainly wasn’t his athleticism. Eventually I learned how to carefully
  pace my bathroom breaks, made friends with other children with whom I would
  whisper, and the hand became unnecessary. Oh! I also learned how to read
  Hebrew, Torah trope and lead the entire service. If this Web site is any
  proof, my mother’s plan worked, and I consider myself to have a strong
  Jewish identity. As far as prayer goes, between the sitting, standing and
  bowing, I do have those genuine moments of connection to something greater
  than myself. But truth be told, I keep the real stuff for when I hit
  turbulence on airplanes or lose my car keys.
