				  <p>Every school year started with the same fantasy.<br />
On the first day of class, I would sit down in the back and not say a word. The teacher, after assaying the course curriculum would bring up a contentious point or perhaps a question about a particular text we were to study. <br />
&#8216;Any thoughts?&#8217; they would ask.<br />
I would remain silent.&nbsp; <br />
Someone would raise their hand with an answer. Another person would offer their thoughts in response to this. A heated debate would break out. The teacher would intervene &#8216;Very good! Very very good! But neither of you are exactly right. Does anyone else have anything to say?&#8217;<br />
Boom.<br />
My hand goes up.<br />
I answer.<br />
The teacher smiles, &#8216;Very interesting Will, I never thought of it that way but that&#8217;s incredibly true and poignant.&#8217;<br />
People would stare back in awe. <br />
The reality of the matter is that I couldn&#8217;t shut up.&nbsp; Whether I wanted to or not I usually said something stupid within the first ten minutes. Then I was stuck with it all year.<br />
In hindsight it was blessing.<br />
Being wise is tough. Really being labeled anything is hard but being called a &#8216;Wise&#8217; must be doubly difficult.<br />
King Solomon is living proof. Two reasons:<br />
1. People come to you for any problem.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not talking matters of state, economic policy or social welfare.&nbsp; I&#8217;m talking two ladies bringing in a baby and arguing whose it was.&nbsp; He must have felt like Jerry Springer and Judge Wapner rolled into one.<br />
2. You can never screw up. Being called wise more or less sets you up for a life of people constantly judging you. Can&#8217;t add up change in your head? And they called YOU wise? Got the wrong size trash bags? REALLY, YOU, WISE? It must be how people who went to Harvard feel. <br />
Granted, for a wise king he did mess up quite a few things. It has been said that he had nearly 700 wives and 300 concubines including the daughter of Egyptian Pharaoh and that in doing so helped to create a sandbank that gave rise to the Roman empire that destroyed the second temple.&nbsp; There are also stories of him releasing the demon king Asmodeus into the world after being tricked and spat out 400 miles away only to be made a beggar.&nbsp; He may have made a few slip ups, but as far as child custody goes, he was a wise guy.
