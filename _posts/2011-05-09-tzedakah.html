				  <p>I once saw a man pray to his golf club.<br />
&#8216;Dear Lord' he whispered softly to the putter, &#8216;please guide my hand steadily with your infinite wisdom, so that I might sink this ball.'<br />
This was a fully developed grown male.<br />
My first thought was that God really doesn't have the time for this kind of nonsense.<br />
War, famine and disease.As it stands the human race is probably on the brink of environmental and nuclear destruction.<br />
God's got a lot on his plate. <br />
So the notion that he cares whether you come in under par is quite simply ridiculous.<br />
But then I started thinking about my own to-do list.<br />
I have to take care of my health insurance premiums, write up some licensing contracts, file for another extension on my taxes and re-register my car. But before all that I start with the easy stuffâ€¦..I have to get a cover for my new Ipad.<br />
So maybe that's why the world is still messed up.Maybe God's taking care of golf games before he gets to the big problems. <br />
Until then it's up to us to fix the world ourselves.<br />
Think about that the next time you put a penny in the pushka.
