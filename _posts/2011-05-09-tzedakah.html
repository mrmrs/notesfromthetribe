<p class="lh-copy measure">
  I once saw a man pray to his golf club. <br />
  ‘Dear Lord’ he whispered softly to the putter, ‘please guide my hand steadily with your infinite wisdom, so that I might sink this ball. ’<br />
  This was a fully developed grown male. <br />
  My first thought was that God really doesn’t have the time for this kind of nonsense. <br />
  War, famine and disease. As it stands the human race is probably on the brink of environmental and nuclear destruction. <br />
  God’s got a lot on his plate. <br />
  So the notion that he cares whether you come in under par is quite simply ridiculous. <br />
  But then I started thinking about my own to-do list. <br />
  I have to take care of my health insurance premiums, write up some licensing contracts, file for another extension on my taxes and re-register my car. But before all that I start with the easy stuff…. . I have to get a cover for my new Ipad. <br />
  So maybe that’s why the world is still messed up. Maybe God’s taking care of golf games before he gets to the big problems. <br />
  Until then it’s up to us to fix the world ourselves. <br />
  Think about that the next time you put a penny in the pushka.
