  I’m really into worst case scenarios. <br />
  I once sent a strongly worded email to an un named auto mechanic complaining
  about the service I’d received. I was kept waiting over three hours for an oil
  change. In the process they blew the fuses, dislodged the control panel on my
  door, and rolled down a window I specifically told them not to as it would not
  roll back up. In compensation they offered me a discounted rate to fix the
  things they had broke. I was livid. That evening I wrote  three pages stating my
  position as a  loyal customer, unsatisfied with incompetence of the mechanic
  and his staff. My tone was even tempered and firm. In no uncertain terms I vowed
  that if justice was not served, I would never return. I pressed send. As I lay
  in bed I imagined what the Regional Manager would think after reading this
  scathing condemnation of his staff the next morning. He’d be struck by the
  elegant way I laid out my argument, each point building on the one before
  it. Then he’d be incredulous. Could this really be true? In my store?He’d read
  over the well worded argument again and shake his head. How could this be? Fear
  would begin to set in with the horrible revelation that everything was falling
  apart. If I, a ten year gold member was experiencing this kind of service, how
  were the rest of his customers being treated? Actions would be taken. I would
  receive a personal phone call to let me know that I was a valued customer and
  that my claim was being treated with the utmost severity. Next, the CEO’s
  would be alerted to the situation and human resources would be sent out to
  clean house. Everyone would be fired. A new team would be in place by the time
  I arrived that afternoon to have my car fixed for free. Those that were laid
  off would be angry. Without jobs they would have nothing to lose. They still
  had my keys and work order with my credit card number, my name and my address
  on it. They would find me. They would show up at my house with lead pipes and
  bike chains. They would have their revenge. I shot out of bed and wrote
  another email. I explained that I had been very heated in my first email but
  that they should know that while mistakes were made, everyone did what they
  could and that nobody’s job should be in jeopardy. I still haven’t heard
  back.

  Going through life like this is exhausting. Seeing the potential life
  threatening danger in day to day activities requires a maddening vigilance. So
  it’s nice to have a mezuzah on the doorway of my house. I need all the
  protection I can get.
