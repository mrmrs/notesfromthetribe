				  <p>I&#8217;m really into worst case scenarios.<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp; I once sent a strongly worded email to an un named auto mechanic complaining about the service I&#8217;d received. I was kept waiting over three hours for an oil change.&nbsp; In the process they blew the fuses, dislodged the control panel on my door, and rolled down a window I specifically told them not to as it would not roll back up.&nbsp; In compensation they offered me a discounted rate to fix the things they had broke.&nbsp; I was livid.&nbsp; That evening I wrote  three pages stating my position as a  loyal customer, unsatisfied with incompetence of the mechanic and his staff.&nbsp; My tone was even tempered and firm.&nbsp; In no uncertain terms I vowed that if justice was not served, I would never return.&nbsp; I pressed send.&nbsp; As I lay in bed I imagined what the Regional Manager would think after reading this scathing condemnation of his staff the next morning. He&#8217;d be struck by the elegant way I laid out my argument, each point building on the one before it.&nbsp; Then he&#8217;d be incredulous.&nbsp; Could this really be true? In my store?&nbsp; He&#8217;d read over the well worded argument again and shake his head.&nbsp; How could this be? Fear would begin to set in with the horrible revelation that everything was falling apart.&nbsp; If I, a ten year gold member was experiencing this kind of service, how were the rest of his customers being treated? Actions would be taken. I would receive a personal phone call to let me know that I was a valued customer and that my claim was being treated with the utmost severity. Next, the CEO&#8217;s would be alerted to the situation and human resources would be sent out to clean house. Everyone would be fired. A new team would be in place by the time I arrived that afternoon to have my car fixed for free. Those that were laid off would be angry. Without jobs they would have nothing to lose. They still had my keys and work order with my credit card number, my name and my address on it. They would find me. They would show up at my house with lead pipes and bike chains. They would have their revenge. I shot out of bed and wrote another email. I explained that I had been very heated in my first email but that they should know that while mistakes were made, everyone did what they could and that nobody&#8217;s job should be in jeopardy.&nbsp; I still haven&#8217;t heard back.<br />
 Going through life like this is exhausting.&nbsp; Seeing the potential life threatening danger in day to day activities requires a maddening vigilance. So it&#8217;s nice to have a mezuzah on the doorway of my house. I need all the protection I can get.
