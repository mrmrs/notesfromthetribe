Ah yes, it’s that time of year again. When our well meaning yet misinformed
gentile friends compare and contrast the celebration of the birth of their
savior to our commemoration of the re dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem
after the Maccabees drove out the armies of Antiochus IV, which is a bit like
saying that Easter and April Fools Day are the same thing because they happen in
the same month. These holidays, however, vary both in their meaning and
importance. Similarly,  celebrating Hanukkah in comparison to Christmas is like
having eight coupons for a free game at the local bowling alley while everyone
else is going to Disney World— it’s fun; it’s just not that big a deal for us.
That said, there are still a few myths I’ve heard over the years that I’d like
to clear up:
</p>
<p>
1)’‘Don’t you guys get like eight nights of presents?” NO WE DO NOT.  At least,
I didn’t (perhaps this is just the bitterness in me talking).  We were lucky if
we got one present, let alone some doughnut holes after the candle lighting.
There are some exceptions to the rule, but again, even in a case like this, the
general trend is: as quantity goes up, quality goes down. So say goodbye to that
iPod and say hello to a sweater, a CD case, socks, a book, some deodorant, a
frame, chap stick and a beanie baby.
</p>
<p>
2)“The Hanukkah Bush.” While I’ve never actually seen this, I believe that there
is truth to the claim that a small minority of us celebrate the Maccabean
victory and holy miracle of the menorah by decorating shrubbery in the living
room. While I myself do not do this, it would make a lot more sense if one were
to burn the bush during the reading of Exodus as a reminder of God talking to
Moses.
</p>
<p>
3)“But you still celebrate Christmas right?” Sure we do. If by celebrating you
mean making the rounds to your living room on December 25th to nab one of those
delicious gift baskets with the caramel popcorn and hazelnut body lotion.
However, all interfaith relationships and Messianic Jews aside, most of us
celebrate your holy day by enjoying the peace of empty movie theatres and
Chinese restaurants. Being as the only thing on television is It’s a Wonderful
Life and the separation of church and state in the United States has rendered
Christmas a national holiday, there’s really not a whole lot going on for us
apart from that.
Hopefully this clears up any misconceptions.  I can’t wait for Yom Kippur.
</p>
<p>
Happy Hanukkah everyone, Will.
