<p>
  My Father was a Shofar.<br />
  He was born from the crude horn of a ram.<br />
  Then softened, flattened, and polished into a beautiful instrument that was
  complex to play yet obtusely simple in it’s construction.<br />
  An object equally spiritual and utilitarian.<br />
  Though often silent, when called upon his sonic force brought down the walls
  of Jericho, signaled the New Year, and made the monsters under my bed go
  away.<br />
  They were long deep sounds without melody whose notes still resonate long
  after they’ve been played.
