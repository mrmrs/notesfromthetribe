  An epiphany is defined as a moment of realization.  Mine came whilst urinating
  in front of two dancing Hassidic Jews at a shivah minyan of all places.  I was,
  of course, in the restroom, and the two men were encased in a glass frame that
  hung above the toilet. At that moment, it occurred to me that this was not the
  first time the three of us had met in such a fashion. In fact, growing up in the
  Orthodox, and later, when my mother joined the Cantorate, the Conservative
  community, one thing had remained constant:the art.  Regardless of denomination,
  nearly every Jewish house I went to had the same three defining aesthetics:
  1)Chagall prints 2)Tacky abstract 80’s metal wall sculpture and 3) Pictures of
  frum Jews dancing and/or playing some sort of Klezmer instrument in or around
  the bathroom. In spite of these similarities, I found that none of this work
  spoke about the modern Jewish experience.  In my family alone there is a
  Conservative Cantor, an observant Orthodox Jew, an atheist, and an agnostic;
  yet, all of us identify strongly as Jews.  So I took it upon myself to make
  paintings that encapsulate the essence of what it is that ties us all together.
  The result is this ongoing collection of work I call “Notes from the Tribe.”
  Each week I’ll release a limited archival print of work available for purchase
  along with a few words.  I invite you to leave your own notes, comments, and
  suggestions on the site, as the views expressed don’t come from the tribe
  itself, just one of its loving members.

  p.s. A little bit about me; my name is Will, I studied art at UCLA and currently
  live in Los Angeles obsessively making pictures.  Were I at all athletically
  inclined, my life may have gone a completely different direction, but as it
  stands my 5’7’’ frame was suitable for mostly cerebral and cultural pursuits.
  Oh, and the red stamp is a signature of my Hebrew name as spelled by a five year
  old me. In learning the alef-bet, I found the difference between a chet and a
  final mem perplexing, but I like the unpredictability of life, so I kept it.
