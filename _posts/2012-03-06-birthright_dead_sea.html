				  <p>&nbsp;  &nbsp; The Essenes were an ascetic group of religious Jews that were believed to have stemmed from the Zadokite priests in 2nd century BCE.&nbsp; They were a minority  in comparison to the Sadducees and the Pharisees, and lived a life of celibacy and a poverty, dedicated to freeing themselves of earthly desires. However, if they did in fact live near the Dead Sea, then it could be argued that this ancient group of mystics had the creamiest, softest skin, of any sect of Jews in history.
