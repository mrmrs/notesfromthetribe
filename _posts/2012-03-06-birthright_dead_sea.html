<p class="lh-copy measure">
  The Essenes were an ascetic group of religious Jews that were believed to have
  stemmed from the Zadokite priests in 2nd century BCE. They were a minority  in
  comparison to the Sadducees and the Pharisees, and lived a life of celibacy
  and a poverty, dedicated to freeing themselves of earthly desires. However, if
  they did in fact live near the Dead Sea, then it could be argued that this
  ancient group of mystics had the creamiest, softest skin, of any sect of Jews
  in history.
