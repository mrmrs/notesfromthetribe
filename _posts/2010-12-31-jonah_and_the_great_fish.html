  As a child, I used to hope that something horrible would happen to me.
</p>
<p>
  I was not sado-masochistic by any stretch, I just wanted to be a little
  darkerâ€¦.a little more tortured.The kind of thing that when revealed to a cute
  girl in my class, would make her  reach for my shoulder to comfort me, at
  which point I'd calmly brush it away and say &#8216;You can't help me, I'm
  messed up, Okay?' This is of course would only stoke her desires.She'd feel
  an instant connection to me and I to her as we shared my dark past.
</p>
<p>
  I secretly wished that my father would hit me, that my parents would die in a
  car crash, that I had an incurable disease, that I would be kidnapped and held
  for ransom in someone's basement, that I had survived an attack from wild
  animals, that I had spent years in correctional facilities for manslaughter, or
  that I  would find out that I had been adopted.
</p>
<p>
  Anything that would leave physical or emotional scars.<br />
  But alas, nothing ever did.<br />
  There was some shouting and the occasional punishment, but as it was I lead a mostly charmed life in the suburbs of Orange County.<br />
  Jonah on the other hand was thrown overboard during a storm and swallowed by a giant fish.<br />
  He must've gotten all the chicks.
