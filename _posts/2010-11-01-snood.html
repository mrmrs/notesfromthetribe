<p>Snood.</p>

<p>
  For some, the word evokes images of a large circular blue face with red clown

  lips and hours wasted in front of a computer. A rip off of Taito’s
  popular ‘Bust-A-Move” video game, the 1996 puzzler involves
  grouping various series of disembodied heads in hopes of clearing the entire
  screen. So addicted was I to this time wasting device that I  asked my
  roommates freshman year to delete it from my computer when I was away at
  class.
</p>

<p>
  For others, it is one of many ways to cover your head. While Kippot tend to
  reap the glory of Jewish head coverings, it is common for women to use a
  Snood (as pictured), Scheitel (Wig) or Tichel (Headscarf) as headpieces. It
  is all part of Tznuit, a code of modesty and humility and practiced by many
  Jews. And one of the main reasons Kanye West will never be Orthodox.
