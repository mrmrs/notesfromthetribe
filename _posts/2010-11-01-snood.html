				  <p>Snood.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For some, the word evokes images of a large circular blue face with red clown lips and hours wasted in front of a computer.&nbsp; A rip off of Taito&#8217;s popular &#8216;Bust-A-Move&#8221; video game, the 1996 puzzler involves grouping various series of disembodied heads in hopes of clearing the entire screen.&nbsp; So addicted was I to this time wasting device that I  asked my roommates freshman year to delete it from my computer when I was away at class. </p>

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For others, it is one of many ways to cover your head.&nbsp; While Kippot tend to reap the glory of Jewish head coverings, it is common for women to use a Snood (as pictured), Scheitel (Wig) or Tichel (Headscarf) as headpieces.&nbsp; It is all part of Tznuit, a code of modesty and humility and practiced by many Jews.&nbsp; And one of the main reasons Kanye West will never be Orthodox.
