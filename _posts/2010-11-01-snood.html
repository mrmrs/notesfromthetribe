<p>Snood.</p>

<p>
  For some, the word evokes images of a large circular blue face with red clown

  lips and hours wasted in front of a computer. A rip off of Taito’s
  popular ‘Bust-A-Move” video game, the 1996 puzzler involves
  grouping various series of disembodied heads in hopes of clearing the entire
  screen. So addicted was I to this time wasting device that I  asked my
  roommates freshman year to delete it from my computer when I was away at
  class.

  For others, it is one of many ways to cover your head. While Kippot tend to
  reap the glory of Jewish head coverings, it is common for women to use a
  Snood (as pictured), Scheitel (Wig) or Tichel (Headscarf) as headpieces. It
  is all part of Tznuit, a code of modesty and humility and practiced by many
  Jews. And one of the main reasons Kanye West will never be Orthodox.
