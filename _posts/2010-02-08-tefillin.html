It’s a well known fact that Jews are very into leather and bondage.  In fact, we do it at least six days a week; sometimes by ourselves, often with others. It’s not uncommon for some of us to proposition total strangers off the street to do it with us.  We’ll even teach them if they don’t know how.  For children, it is a rite of passage. Obviously, I’m speaking of the leather tefillin we wear to remind us of when G-d brought the children of Israel forth from bondage in Egypt. Thus, it is only with suppressed schoolboy giggles (double entendre in mind) that I will attempt to go about explaining how to lay them.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
    1. Wake up. Not an easy task considering morning services begin at first light, and especially difficult when you spend your time drawing Jews until the wee hours.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
    2. If you’re an Ashkenazi Jew, stand and then put on your talit (that’s the large piece of cloth with the tassels you got during your Bar or Bat Mitzvah).
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
    3. Place the shel yad (arm piece) facing toward your heart on your bicep. Say the blessing and wrap it around your arm seven times (there should be more than enough strap to contain the python on your arm as well as wrap it around seven times).
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
    4. Tie a knot around your hand according to your tradition.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
    5. Place the shel rosh (head piece) on your forehead above the hairline. In what I can only imagine is consideration for the alarming rate of male pattern baldness in the Jewish community, the hairline may be approximated to where it was in one’s youth. Ashkenazim say another blessing for the shel rosh before it is tightened.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
    6. The two ends of the head piece should fall over the shoulders reaching the genitals on the right and the navel on the left.  Considering that I’m 5’7’’ and fully proportional, my straps have no problem meeting their required distances.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
    7. Finally, the remaining arm piece strap is wrapped three times around the hand and middle finger to form the letter shin.  Short of a Jewish mafia, this is the closest we will ever get to throwing up gang signs (Ashkenazi knots look like a ‘west side’).
  </p>

    To lay tefillin is a great mitzvah in Judaism, commanded four separate times in the Torah and referenced 500 separate times in the Talmud.  Originally, they were worn all day. Only in modern times has it become common practice to do so during weekday services. Could you imagine if we collectively spent that kind of time doing light cardio and free weights?  Perhaps then we as a people could finally cast off the narrow-minded stereotype of the waifish intellectual.  It may not be a “Stairmaster” or treadmill, but the obligation of tefillin, with its placement on the arm and head, is designed to bring sanctity to our hearts and minds by reminding us of G-d.  And we are very, very into it.
