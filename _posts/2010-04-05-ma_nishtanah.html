  I gave my  tenth and last performance of the Ma Nishtanah
  during the second night of  seder at the age of ten. Friends and family
  gathered around the table to witness the  final impassioned rendition.
  You see, when you&#8217;re the son of a Cantor, people expect a lot of
  you.& And I delivered year after year.& Question after question.
  That night was no exception.& Some children need the crutch of
  transliteration. I didn&#8217;t even need a Hagaddah. Going completely
  off book, I begged of the table: &#8220;Ma nishtana ha-laila ha-zeh mi-kol
  ha-leilot?&#8221;& Without a script, I had the freedom to gesture, to
  look into their eyes and demand to know why we were dipping our herbs twice
  that evening. To my recollection there was applause. But truth be told, the
  glory of the four questions is short lived. There&#8217;s always someone
  younger, cuter, just waiting to take your place.& And quite literally,
  with a baby sister who was turning five, I was getting too old for it.
</p>
<p>
  I haven&#8217;t sung that song in 16 years. So this year, I created a new set
  of questions that have been on my mind:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    If the purpose of engaging the children during the seder is to fulfill the
    duty of passing the story down, wouldn&#8217;t it make more sense just to
    plop them in front of a television and pop in &#8220;The Prince of
    Egypt?&#8221; The story itself is far less convoluted than the one in the
    Haggadah.& Not to mention the fact that it is told through a medium
    targeted at children, complete with modern animation and an award winning
    sound track. I&#8217;m an adult and still have trouble wrapping my head
    around the part about the five rabbis and difference between anger, wrath,
    indignation, trouble and messengers of evil.
  </li>
  <li>
    I know that it&#8217;s not particularly Jewish, but being as it is probably
    the most famous seder, I can&#8217;t help but wonder: who sang the Ma
    Nishtanah at the last supper (I would assume it was John as he was the
    youngest disciple)? Furthermore did they have an afikoman? And if everyone
    present was eating matzah why are they never depicted with crumbs all over
    their robes? Also, at the end did they bother saying &#8216;Next year in
    Jerusalem?&#8217;
  </li>
  <li>When do we eat?*</li>
</ol>
<p>
  *In the interest of the third question, I have removed the fourth.<br />
  Happy Passover Everyone.<br /> NEXT YEAR IN JERUSALEM!!!!!
