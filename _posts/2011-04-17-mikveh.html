<p>
  I feel bad for Jewish vampires.
</p>
<p>
  I mean here they are, constantly surrounded by death, decay and abnormal
  discharges of body fluid, yet they cannot step foot in a body of running
  water.
</p>
<p>
  Especially not the holy baths of a mikveh.
</p>
<p>
  They donâ€™t much like crosses either.
</p>
<p>
  I guess the undead must be Buddhists.
