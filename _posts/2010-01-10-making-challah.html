  If you could have tasted my mother’s challah in 1984, it would not have
  shocked anyone but her to know that a decade or so later she would be a
  Cantor.  She began by removing her wedding ring. Next, the ingredients were
  measured and mixed, kneaded and braided, and baked into what became the crown
  jewel of Friday night dinners. The standard was poppy seed, occasionally
  sesame, and a few failed experiments with raisin and wheat.  Each was
  characterized by a crisp golden exterior which gave way to a soft buttery
  bliss.  This was the bread that served as mops for sauce, a spoon for soup,
  and casing for midweek leftovers.  Any person who can put that much ruach into
  a loaf of dough is bound to find other outlets for it.  So it came as no
  surprise when my mother announced that she would be serving as Rabbi for our
  congregation’s sisterhood Shabbat.  The challah barely made it to the table
  that week, but her sermon was superb.  She had discovered that her mastery of
  the sabbath extended outside the reaches of the kitchen.  And when my great
  uncle, Cantor David Gordon passed away, it seemed only fitting that she should
  take up the mantle. However, being a woman Cantor in your 40’s with no formal
  training in the saturated market of Orange County where there are more gated
  communities than jewish people does not make things easy. So she hit the
  streets and started working the circuit.  In addition to making delicious food
  each week, my mother began her training as an assistant Cantor at our
  synagogue, learning the ropes of leading prayer. Life was more or less how it
  had been before, I would get two loaves a week in return for sitting through
  what I considered to be unbearable drudgery at the time. But the people wanted
  more.  Soon she was working paid gigs.  Friday night stuff.  The folks over at
  Villa Valencia wanted her to be their clergy in residence.  It began to dawn
  on me that the cornucopia of carbohydrates was running dry.  While I could
  look forward to the home cooked stuff now and again, the amount of preparation
  required for Kabbalat Shabbat meant that I was stuck with the occasional
  store-bought starch.  Then came the big time.  After a brief stint at B’nai
  Israel, and working for years as a part time spiritual advisor, my mother
  found her home as Cantor of Heritage Pointe.  And I said hello to frozen
  challah.  It’s not so bad though. In a way I was lucky. Some kids only get to
  hear services once a week. I got to hear them every day. All my friends had to
  go to the temple to learn their haftorah, I got to say mine every night for a
  year before I went to bed. Oh and the bread is pretty good too- once you toast
  it.
