  Dear Bar Mitzvah boy,
</p>
<p>
      It’s not your fault. Despite the uncontrollable acne, the braces that have
      at least three years to come off, even though you’ve only just made the
      transition from briefs to boxer shorts and the only bare bosom you’ve come
      close to is your mother’s long ago, with no house, no property, no
      prospects, not even a bathroom of your own; you’ve awoken one fine morning
      at the tender age of 13, a full grown man. What does this mean for you?
      Well, if you didn’t already, you’ll be spending a lot more time in
      synagogue— actually in it this time, not out in the lobby or in the
      parking lot with friends. Don’t worry; their time will come soon enough.
      Though you’re told that this is your big day, admittedly it’s a slight
      misnomer; your mother will be making all the preparations. She will,
      however, ask for your opinion as this is ultimately your decision and
      yours alone. And, if you decide to let down your entire family, extended
      relatives, community at large and culture as a whole by turning your back
      on a time honored tradition, that is completely your choice. Though the
      parsha you will be reading is more or less delegated by the month of your
      birth, it is important to explain in your speech how it uniquely relates
      to you and your relationship with Judaism, how the experience of being
      driven to haftorah practice each week and possibly collecting canned food
      or cleaning up a beach has strengthened your position as a Jew in the
      world. Oh, and don’t forget to thank everyone (consider using a well
      mannered jibe at sibling or parent for comedic effect).  If at any point
      on the bimah your voice should stop, stutter, or crack, DO NOT PANIC.
      Your performance, no matter how bad, will be met with only the highest
      accolades by relatives and friends.  Your out-of-town guests will assure
      you that it was well worth the flight from London, the delay in New York
      and the restless sleep on the old fold-out in the living room to hear a
      torah portion that divine. These sentiments, of course, will all be echoed
      in the slurry of speeches from community and clergy members alike, each
      tearfully attesting that what has happened this morning and the months
      leading up to it is nothing short of a small miracle. This must all seem
      like a lot of trouble for your thirteenth birthday, but look at it this
      way: once you’re an adult, you won’t have to come back to synagogue until
      High Holidays.
      Happy Birthday, Will.
</p>
