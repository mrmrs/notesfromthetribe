				  <p>&nbsp;  The penalty for dropping a Torah in the Jewish faith is 40 days of fasting for the one who dropped it as well as those who witnessed.<br />
In my 26 years I&#8217;ve never seen anyone drop a Torah.&nbsp; <br />
I&#8217;ve never even heard of such a thing.<br />
So I googled it.<br />
I got exactly one result.&nbsp; <br />
A woman on Yahoo answers related the story of a young man who had taken a spill during his Bar Mitzvah during the procession.<br />
Wow.&nbsp; Only one result? Pretty amazing considering all the factors working against us:<br />
1. The Torah: The scrolls are not exactly an ergonomically designed. Stiff and rigid, these bundles are like carrying two blocks of wood held together by a tightly wound phone book. Though there are handles, the dressing can be so top heavy that holding them would be a grievous mistake.&nbsp; Moreover, the coverings are often made of velvet which slips away from suit jackets with ease.<br />
2. Our Bodies: Short of lugging heavy stones to build the pyramids when we were slaves in the house of bondage before the Holy One, Blessed Be he, brought us forth with an outstretched arm, Jews are not exactly known for our physical prowess.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen everyone from an adolescent to an elderly woman given the honor of carrying the Torah.<br />
3. The situation: You&#8217;re not just holding the thing. Rather you are asked to take this cumbersome foreign object all the way around the synagogue.&nbsp; Up and down steps, around corners and through crowds. There are no spotters, nobody to break your fall. To the contrary there are people blocking your path, darting out their hands and running across the aisle just to get a piece of what you&#8217;ve got.&nbsp;  Add to this the constant distraction of singing and the metallic jingling of the ritual ornamentation.<br />
It&#8217;s a veritable obstacle course.<br />
Maybe the instances of fallen Sefer Torah&#8217;s simply hasn&#8217;t been documented, or maybe when it happens everyone agrees not to talk about it. Or maybe we&#8217;re just that good.
