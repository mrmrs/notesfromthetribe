  Dear Adam,
</p>
<p>
  I’m a little hurt. I feel like haven’t seen you since the sixth day.  It seems
  all you do since that floozy was created from your rib is galavant around
  naked naming animals.  Speaking of which….serpent?  I know I walk on four
  legs, but that’s a little harsh. Anyhow, I’m just writing to let you know that
  your so-called “companion” should be arriving any minute with an apple and a
  RIDICULOUS story about how I convinced her to eat it. Nothing could be further
  from the truth. Maybe the Big Guy should have made her from your head and and
  not your side, because she tends to think with her stomach and not her
  brain….am I right or am I right!?!  Like I said, do not eat it.  And between
  you and me, if you want to just let her take a bite, we can get her out of
  here and really make this place paradise like the old days! YEAH!
</p>
<p>
  Love, the Serpent.<br>
  (we’ll talk about my name later, I was thinking maybe you could call me a lawyer or car mechanic)
</p>
