<p>JDate. </p>
<p>
  It’s a bit like rocking out front row at a Jonas Brother’s
  concert only to lock eyes with someone you know mid fist pump. There’s
  a moment of embarrassment cut short by the acknowledgment that both of you
  came for the same thing. In this case it’s the sweet sweet musical
  stylings of Joe and the gang, and in the case of Jdate it’s
  romance. And why should you be ashamed of online dating? The general
  rule of thumb is as follows: if Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have made a movie
  about it, chances are that it is romantic. This would also explain why the
  duo haven’t made a movie about getting drunk and meeting someone at a
  bar. But really it makes sense, if you were looking for kosher meat,
  would you go to a treif butcher?Now to extend the metaphor even
  further, imagine that not only is JDate a kosher butcher, but they have the
  largest meat market in the world, so you should be able to find just the cut
  you’re looking for.
</p>
<p>
  That said, there are still those of us who have trouble meeting someone
  online, so I’ve come up with some general guidelines to get you
  started.
</p>
<p>
  RULE#1 Pictures are everything: Using your head shot says: I only look this
  good with makeup, studio lighting, and heavy photoshopping. Using multiple
  photos of you from one angles says: yes, I have horrible scarring and/or a
  glass eye on the other side. Pictures of you holding a drink with
  somebody’s hand reaching in the frame says: I’m only this
  interesting when I’m drunk, but don’t worry…. I’m drunk a
  lot. Photos of yourself taken shirtless in the mirror with a camera
  phone say: I enjoy curling up with a good novel.
</p>
<p>
  RULE#2 What’s in a name?: I get it. You chose the screen name
  ‘Thuganomics’ because you’re a sensible business man with
  your finger on the pulse of the streets. The problem is she
  won’t.
</p>
<p>
  RULE#3 Know your audience, play up your attributes. . . but be honest: Liking
  movies does not make you a nerd. Nor does cooking or listening to music.
  Owning a dungeon master manual may. Conversely, enjoying sports is different
  than playing them. Oh, and if you have to say that you’re
  creative, crazy, or down to earth, chances are you’re probably not.
</p>
<p>
  Follow these  rules and you’ll be well on your way to being
  ‘flirted with’ or possibly even ‘hotlisted’.
  Fundamentally, the goal of all of this electronic communication is to hopefully
  at long last interact with a living, breathing, person. As for that,
  you’re on your own.
</p>
