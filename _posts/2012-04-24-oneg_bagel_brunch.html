<p class="lh-copy measure">When I say bagel, you say Jewish. </p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">Bagel. </p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">Jewish. </p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  Although my knee jerk reaction is to be mildly offended whenever somebody
  attempts to pigeon hole a culture into a baked good, it is admittedly an
  understandable pairing.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  Like peanut butter and jelly or flannel and Hootie and the Blowfish fans.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  Its also hard to make an argument against this association when they’ve been
  served at literally almost every Jewish function I’ve been to from my own bris
  to a brunch at my family’s house.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  Which would explain why I’ve been I’ve been to a Noah’s Bagels but never a Chang’s. <br />
  So if the two are in fact synonymous, then I’m an awfully bad Jew. <br />
  You see, even Jews who skip high holidays love cream cheese.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  Not me. <br />
  Can’t stand the stuff.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  While I’m coming clean I might as well express my distaste for  smoked
  whitefish, capers, kugel, gefilte fish, falafel, cole slaw, charoset, any kind
  of salad dressing or mayonnaise, matzo balls, tahini sauce, horse radish and
  anything pickled.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  I’ll understand if you need a minute to compose yourself.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  So the next time you’re at an oneg and you see a waifish man in the corner
  eating a plain bagel and a black and white cookie by himself, come say hi.
</p>
