				  <p>I would argue that Jews kiss things more than any other religion on the planet.<br />
While not a direct mandate, kissing is a way of showing reverence and we do it to all sort of things.</p>

<p>Prayer books.<br />
Mezuzahs.<br />
Tallitot.<br />
Tzit tzit.<br />
Tefillin.<br />
Torah mantles.<br />
Torah scrolls.<br />
Paroches.</p>

<p>Also if you go to Jewish summer camp there's a fair amount of it going on.<br />
Oh, and don't forget your mother.
