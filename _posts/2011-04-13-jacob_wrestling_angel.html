  Jacob wrestled with an angel all evening and at daybreak let him go after his
  hip was wrenched.For struggling and overcoming both God and man, he was
  blessed and given the name ‘Israel’.

<p class="lh-copy measure">
  I had my pants pulled down in second grade by some cruel classmates who wanted
  to embarrass me during a rainy day assembly.Because the entire school saw, I
  was given the name ‘Little Willy’.
