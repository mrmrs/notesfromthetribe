<p class="lh-copy measure">
  My friend Brian spent his entire seventh grade summer practicing at a basketball camp. When he returned in the Fall it was clear his jump shot had vastly improved.<br />
  Similarly, Gary had gone to space camp and was way ahead of us when it came to astronomy and physics.<br />
  I went to Jewish sleep away camp that year and learned to french kiss.<br />
  Indeed, though Gary had spent the past ten weeks involved in athletics it was I who had rounded first base.<br />
  To be clear, I had kissed a girl before.<br />
  Literally ‘a’ girl.<br />
  One.<br />
  It was the result of an embarrassing game of truth or dare at a non parentally supervised graduation party I’d been to in the spring.<br />
  But what separated that encounter from the one I’d experience later that summer was the european quality of the smooch.<br />
  Specifically, tongue.<br />
  Her name was Jen.<br />
  We met after morning prayers on the ropes course.<br />
  As part of trust building exercise we were instructed to fall into one another’s arms, taking turns catching and being caught.<br />
  I was smitten.<br />
  As was the protocol I had my bunkmate Jared ask her friend Michelle if she wanted to be my girlfriend at lunch.<br />
  By free time that afternoon, we were an item.<br />
  This meant she was to sit in my lap while we hung out with her friends on the hill.<br />
  There we sat, saying nothing to each other while kids ate the junk food their parents sent carefully hidden in care packages.<br />
  I had only had one girlfriend before that point, but this was the first one I had ever actually touched.<br />
  The first female I had put my arm around that wasn’t related to me.<br />
  That night, after activities, I took her for a walk near the amphitheater.<br />
  It was common knowledge that this is where people went to ‘french’ and we both knew it.<br />
  I remembered the ‘birds and the bees’ conversation my father and I had earlier that summer regarding technique:<br />
  ‘You must explore every area of the woman’s mouth with your tongue’.<br />
  Like most of his bad advice, it was well intentioned.<br />
  It was messier than I had anticipated. <br />
  Much more technical.<br />
  I’d imagined two puzzle pieces coming together to form a beautiful picture.<br />
  This was more like two anteaters frantically mashing noses together.<br />
  Somehow it seemed more American than French.<br />
  But I wasn’t complaining. <br />
  As far as I was concerned this was a girl who once an evening allowed me to put my tongue in her mouth and for a thirteen year old boy that was good enough.<br />
  The rest of the summer went on like this.<br />
  Make no mistake, Jewish Camp lived up to its name.<br />
  We ate kosher food, prayed three times a day and communed with nature in the hills of Ojai.<br />
  It was both ‘Jewish’ and a ‘Camp.’<br />
  But what it was really about for me was an experience beyond words.
