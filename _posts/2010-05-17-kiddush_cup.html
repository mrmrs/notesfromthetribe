  Let’s play a game called “Two lies, one truth. ”The rules are simple: I will
  list three statements about myself and you will guess which one is the truth.
  So, here we go…
</p>
<ol>
  <li>I hide how I truly feel behind emoticons. </li>
  <li>
    Growing up in Orange County, where there are more Del Tacos than Jewish
    people, being a member of the tribe meant being different. As a minority
    that was excluded from pretty much all elementary school activities in the
    month of December, I found myself needing to defend a religion that was not
    considered by classmates to be ‘fun. ’ Being as they had no
    reference for what Judaism is, and due to the fact that I was a compulsive
    liar, I often played up what I thought were the two redeeming (though
    untrue) Jewish stereotypes: that I got eight presents for Hannukah and that
    I was allowed to drink wine during Kiddush. I explained that not only was
    I allowed to drink on Shabbat, but that I was often drunk during the
    weekends. I informed them that it was very common for a nine-year-old like
    myself to get together with other kids on Friday night and have pizza
    parties with Manischewitz. Not just wine either, I rattled off the library
    of libations in my parents’ liquor cabinet— Johnny Walker, Bacardi,
    Beefeater, etc. I bragged that the ‘8 present rule’ extended to the
    Sabbath, and described in vivid detail the new Nintendo games and Ninja
    Turtle figurines I was given each week. Lucky for me, in truth I had no
    friends during the fourth grade, save for a quiet little boy from Maryland
    who was too timid to question my veracity.

    I don’t use preventative balding shampoo and conditioner on a daily
    basis.

<p>
  That’s right! You guessed it ; - )
