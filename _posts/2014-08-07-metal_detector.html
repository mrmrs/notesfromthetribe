<p>
  My first experience with antisemitism at the age of 8 was also my most direct, violent and formative one.<br />
  It came in the form of a bright, neon green flyer that my distressed parents had brought home from the local high school and left on the dining room table.<br />
  I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.<br />
  The text read ‘If you’ve had enough and you’re ready to kill Jews call this number’. <br />
  There was also a limerick about ‘The Jewish Parasite’, but what struck me was the drawing that accompanied it. <br />
  Two beady eyes presided over a long, beaklike nose. <br />
  Claws clutched at a money belt that was wrapped around a protruding gut.<br />
  Gold chains with Jewish stars spilled forth from a hairy, rodent like chest.<br />
  Drool dripped past sharp teeth, curled up into a greedy grin.<br />
  It wore a yarmulke.<br />
  This wasn’t just racist, it was specific.<br />
  Somebody felt so strongly about me that they took the time to write it, draw it, print it and distribute it. <br />
  Their hatred was a labor of love.<br />
  I don’t think I had the awareness to take it personally. <br />
  I was mostly confused and intrigued. <br />
  I suppose that up to that point I had always thought of myself as just another white person.
</p>
<p>
  Sure, I was a white person who had to take a cooler of Kosher for Passover food to school one week a year but up to that point I had never thought of myself as a minority.<br />
  I knew about Egypt, Germany and Russia but to me those were history lessons of a time gone by.<br />
  Yet here was clear proof that the threat was still very real.<br />
  22 years later, I live in Los Angeles and I’m surrounded by Jews. <br />
  Nobody has ever called me a kike (at least not to my face), or insisted that I’m Jewing them down.<br />
</p>
<p>
  There is the occasional ignorant person who remarks that I don’t look Jewish
  by pointing to my small, button nose but by and large most of my days go by
  uneventfully as just another male, middle class, college educated, privileged
  caucasian.
</p>
<p>
  That is until I turn on the news or walk through a metal detector into a Jewish institution and I’m reminded otherwise.
