  <p class="lh-copy measure">Corned beef, pastrami, turkey pastrami, liver, salami, hard salami, bologna, goulash, tongue, schnitzel, roast turkey, smoked turkey, roast beef, and brisket.</p>

<p class="lh-copy measure">The list makes my mouth water.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="lh-copy measure">In fact living in Orange County we would drive up two hours to Los Angeles just to get my usual: Pastrami on Sourdough with a side of ketchup (I knowâ€¦.ketchup).</p>

<p class="lh-copy measure">Kosher meat the way it was meant to be. </p>

<p class="lh-copy measure">Stacked higher than your jaw can unhinge.</p>

<p class="lh-copy measure">Where bread is a formality and the only veggies you need are the cole slaw and pickles.</p>

<p class="lh-copy measure">Wash it down with a prescription from my favorite Jewish doctor: Browns.</p>

<p class="lh-copy measure">
  Delish.
