<p>
  When I was in college, my goal was to have so much success outside of academics that I could drop out. <br />
  It worked for Brad Pitt, Steve Jobs and Oprah…I thought it could work for me too.<br />
  I had a two part plan.<br />
  Part one: Find something you’re passionate about and work really hard for it.<br />
  Part two: Forsake nearly all other distractions to achieve your goal. Distractions include but are not limited to late night partying, recreational drug use and of course class.<br />
  The first part was fairly easy. I made art and was an actor. I painted constantly and went to auditions on the regular.<br />
  The second part proved a bit more difficult. While I couldn’t completely cut out my social life, I did manage to skip class quite often.<br />
  To be clear I didn’t want to flunk out of college, I wanted to be so wildly successful that I had no other choice but to leave it.<br />
  So I still had to study.<br />
  Even with two majors this was very manageable.<br />
  As an Art major, I just had to keep making the work I was already doing and show up occasionally.<br />
  My Interpersonal Communications major mostly required me to know very complex words to very common sense ideas and occasionally write about my feelings with them.<br />
</p>
<p>
  In either case, the syllabus, reading materials and anything else you could
  need was online or in a textbook. Really the only reason to show up to class
  was if you were an auditory learner or for the midterm and final.
</p>
<p>
  This made skipping class not only easy, but from a time management perspective, prudent.<br />
  I was able to make my life’s work and still receive high marks.<br />
  But after 5 years and two majors, for the sake of tradition, I decided to go to my last week of instruction.<br />
  I’d made it this far and I figured I’d give it a go.<br />
  I even woke up early for the last class I’d ever take at UCLA.<br />
  Communication Studies 116: Counseling Intimate Relationships<br />
</p>
<p>
  Ceremoniously, I put on the outfit I’d wore to my very first day 5 years before, brought an untouched messenger bag and headed off to class.
</p>
<p>
  I showed up about 10 minutes late, which was early for me.<br />
  The room was unusually packed.<br />
  There wasn’t an empty seat in the house.<br />
  Hundreds of students hunched over their desks intensely focused on their…scantrons?!?!?!?!<br />
  It couldn’t be.<br />
  IT.<br />
  COULD.<br />
  NOT.<br />
  BE.<br />
  But it was.<br />
  Everything began to blur. <br />
  To confirm the nightmare that was unfolding in front of me I conferred with one of the T.A.‘s.<br />
  He assured me that had I looked at the syllabus it stated very clearly that the final would happen a week early.<br />
  I promptly went outside and vomited in a bush.<br />
  There’s something that happens to reality when blood is pumping so fast to your heart that your brain can’t keep up.<br />
  I marched back inside directly to the professor.<br />
  ‘I’m so sorry, I had no idea the final was today. My Grandmother just passed and I just lost track of everything.’<br />
</p>
<p>
  A side note here. Yes. That is the worst, most cliched excuse in the history
  of excuses…but my heart goes out to those of you who have actually lost a
  grandparent at a time when you had to take a final and nobody would believe
  you.
</p>
<p>
  Not me though. <br />
  I was a bold faced, panicked liar that smelled of barf.<br />
  And he wasn’t buying it. ‘I’m sorry to hear about your Grandmother Mr. Deutsch, why don’t you grab a scantron and we can talk about this later.’<br />
  I borrowed a #2 pencil and laid down in the middle of the lecture hall on my empty stomach.<br />
  At least it was multiple choice. <br />
  And everybody was fond of making fun of Communications as a ‘common sense’ course anyway.<br />
  Based on the B+ I got, it turns out they were right.<br />
  But the moral of that story has always stuck with me. Had I simply read the supplementary materials closely I would’ve seen exactly when the final was.<br />
  Case in point: ALWAYS read the fine print.
</p>
<p>
  If Jacob had learned this lesson, maybe he wouldn’t have had to work an extra
  7 years.
