<p>Dear Diary,<br />
Do you remember that camping trip my Dad has been promising to take me on for
the past month? The one to mount Moriah? Well, today he finally took me.& And I
have to preface this by saying that I was completely stoked to go. I mean,
things have been rough around here since we kicked out Ishmael and the idea of
a vacation just seemed really nice.& But this morning as we were packing up to
go, he appeared to be very irritable.& The entire hike up we didn&#8217;t joke,
didn&#8217;t talk, didn&#8217;t even look at each other!& So we finally reached
the top of the mountain, and he looks like he&#8217;s about to cry, so….I ask
him if anything is wrong, and with tears in his eyes he yells at me to gather
wood.& At this point I&#8217;m kind of freaking out.& Here we are, in the
middle of nowhere and he&#8217;s completely despondent, just frantically
building an altar….and then he tells me to lay down on it.& Now I&#8217;m
legitimately afraid, but I do as he says.& He binds my hands&#8212;tight. He
starts talking to himself, arguing, pacing back and forth with a knife in his
hand while I lay there completely subdued and shaking like a leaf. His back and
forth becomes more and more frenzied, and in one fluid motion he plunges the
blade toward me, and….SURPRISE!!!!!& It was a joke!!!! Can you believe that
!?!?!?!& Oh man! My heart was beating like a million miles a minute!& I mean I
really thought he was going to kill me!!!& The old man really got me good!!!&
He&#8217;s still got it.& Anyway, we had a good laugh and he explained that he
brought me up there so we could have a good ol&#8217; father and son hunting
trip together. Luckily there was a ram caught in a thicket nearby that we could
easily slaughter, so we made our sacrifice and headed back down the mountain.&
Dad admitted that he couldn&#8217;t take all of the credit, because God came up
with the initial idea.& But man oh man, it&#8217;ll teach me not to mess with
those two practical jokers!!! Though for a prank, he did seem oddly relieved.
Anyway, that was the best camping trip ever.</p>

<p>Talk to you tomorrow diary! You&#8217;re my best friend…well besides my Dad!</p>

<p>Love, Isaac.  </p>
