<p class="lh-copy measure">
  One minor confession. <br />
  On September 26th 2000, I went to FYE and purchased a copy of the R and B group 98 Degrees’ album Revelation the day it came out. <br />
  It was the follow up to my favorite of their records, ‘98 Degrees and Rising. ’<br />
  Full disclosure: I was a closeted boy band fanatic. <br />
  N’Sync. <br />
  Backstreet Boys. <br />
  LFO. <br />
  BBMak. <br />
  Westlife.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  Even O-Town (I selfishly bought the C. D. for my sister’s birthday). <br />
  Though I can now come to grips with this in sort of an
  ironic-hipster-its-so-uncool-that-it-is-cool way…. much how I’ve accepted my
  obsession with the card game Magic The Gathering…. . as a sixteen year old male
  trying to fit into a mold of classic teenage masculinity it was a closely
  guarded secret. </p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  Don’t get me wrong, I also genuinely enjoyed other kinds of music ranging from
  grunge to hip hop, but there was something about these crooners that spoke to
  my sensibilities.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  It wasn’t their style…. I would’ve never frosted my tips or worn rhinestone bandanas. <br />
  Nor their dance moves…. in fact I wasn’t crazy about the club hits that got radio play. <br />
  I think it was their soulful, unabashed expressions of love towards the women they sung about. <br />
  Much like Nick Lachey sings on 1997’s’ ‘98 Degrees’ I often felt like the ‘Invisible Man. ’<br />
  I wanted a love that was ‘like a river, peaceful and deep’ and knew all too well of females that wouldn’t ‘quit playing games with my heart. ’<br />
  I was a romantic. <br />
  I still am. <br />
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  Yet with all this talk of love, I’ve never given more than a passing thought to my own wedding. <br />
  I’m not terrified of marriage, I just don’t think about it all that much.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  Some people know exactly what that day is going to look like for them down to
  the place cards. <br>
  For some reason, the only thing I’m sure of is that I want to have a Round
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  Table cheese pizza light cheese extra sauce on a thin crust waiting for me at
  the reception.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  It’s something I came up with when I was six. <br />
  Weird,I know. <br />
  Oh, I also know a few of the songs we’ll be playing…. .
