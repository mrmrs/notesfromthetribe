  The Essenes were an ascetic group of religious Jews that were believed
  to have stemmed from the Zadokite priests in 2nd century BCE. They were a
  minority  in comparison to the Sadducees and the Pharisees, and lived a life
  of celibacy and poverty, dedicated to freeing themselves of earthly desires.
  However, if they did in fact live near the Dead Sea, then it could be argued
  that this ancient group of mystics had the creamiest, softest skin, of any
  sect of Jews in history. Just imagine the exfoliation, taking daily mud baths
  and facials in the hyper saline waters.
</p>
<p>
  While in the past the Dead Sea has served as a refuge to King David, a health
  spa to Herod the Great, and as an essential ingredient to the incense of the
  second Temple, today it is one of the biggest tourist attractions in Israel.
  There are three unspoken obligations anyone who makes pilgrimage there must
  fulfill:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Take a large amount of mud. Rub the mud all over oneself. Find others who
    are doing the same. Take a picture. (After washing the mud off, it is
    custom for some to touch themselves exclaiming in disbelief how absolutely
    smooth they are).
  </li>
  <li>Find a friend or likable stranger. Make a joke
    warning of the dangers of urination/ defecating into the body of water in
    question. Laugh at your cleverness.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get a periodical of some sort. Lay back in the water while simultaneously
    looking at the periodical and maintaining a look of  both comfort and
    nonchalance despite any back or neck support. Take a picture.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Indeed, the novelty of bathing in what is often referred to as ‘The
  Salt Sea’ ranks highly on the list of common pictures you might see
  from someone who went to Israel including: ‘Riding a
  camel’,‘Eating falafel’,‘Riding a camel while eating
  falafel’,‘Closing your eyes in silent devotion in front of the
  Western Wall’,‘Taking a picture with an Israeli soldier or
  someone with a rifle’,‘Hanging out and/or smoking hooka at an
  Israeli discotheque’ and finally ‘A picture with you and some
  other people wearing a hat and sunglasses in some part of the Israeli
  wilderness because most Birthright/USY/BBYO/NIFTY/Hadassah trips love taking
  you on hikes’. <br />
  If I forgot any, let me know in the comments below!And happy Israeli
  Independence Day to everyone!
