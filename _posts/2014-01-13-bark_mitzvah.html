<p>
  The Bark Mitzvah, first introduced in 1977, combines the age old Jewish
  tradition of B’nai mitzvah with the age old Jewish tradition of making
  awful puns.
</p>
<p>
  At the age of 13 months, owners throw a party for their pet and dress them in
  a yarmulke and tallis for the occasion.
</p>
<p>
  While some see it as a desecration of sacred practices, others see it as a
  way to mark their dog’s transition into adulthood.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless, the owner is still required to pick up their excrement.
