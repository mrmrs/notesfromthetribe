  Short of forcing every performer to eat Bagels and smoked whitefish on camera, I think one would be hard pressed to find anything that could make the the Chabad ‘To Life’ telethon more ‘Jewish’.
</p>
<p>
  The program is well known for its Bearded Hassidic Rabbis in black hats
  ebulliently dancing to Klezmer in front of a giant tote board and portrait of
  the Rebbe whilst a cavalcade of celebrities try their best Catskills comedic
  routine or sing traditional yiddish folk songs.
</p>

<p>
  And all in the name of charity. Over the course of the 31 broadcasts, they’ve
  raised millions of dollars for social services that range from education to
  rehabilitation.
</p>

<p>
  Using their influence to help countless people from all backgrounds. <br />
  Like I said, typically Jewish.
