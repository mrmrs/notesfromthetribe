  Michael Bay. What a Tzadik.
  Upon viewing the director’s 1998 big screen epic, Armageddon, it is clear that
  the film was intended to be a modern day telling of Noah’s ark through the
  character of Harry Stamper (played by Bruce Willis).  Like his biblical
  counterpart, Harry is a simple man charged with saving the human race from
  certain extinction.  While Noah had to build a large boat to survive a great
  flood, Harry must build a large drill to dig into a comet the size of Texas in
  order to detonate a nuclear warhead.  Noah takes two of every animal with him,
  Harry must bring two of every astronaut and drill team member so as to have a
  failsafe.  In the Torah, God’s covenant to never again send a deluge is
  symbolized by a beautiful rainbow.  Similarly, at the end of the movie a
  brilliant light illuminates the sky from the explosion of the comet thus
  signifying that humanity has been saved. Granted, there are some key
  differences. Noah is chosen by God because of his character, Harry on the
  other hand is a shoe in because he is the best oil driller on the planet.  In
  one story it could be said that God spared the earth, while in the other man
  saved it. Ultimately this leads to Noah repopulating the earth while Harry
  must sacrifice himself by staying on the doomed rock.  More than a tour de
  force blockbuster nominated for four Oscars and winner of two MTV awards and a
  Teen Choice award (Best actor: Ben Affleck), this is a two hour and twenty
  four minute drash cautioning us that the same fate beset us in Genesis is
  still a possibility today.  Whether you’re an atheist or interpret the bible
  literally, there is little doubt that from war, to disease, to natural
  disaster, terrible things happen.  In either view it could also be said that
  mankind is the cause of this whether through incurring the wrath of the
  almighty or killing each other, changing our ecosystem and effecting climate
  change. But what these two stories point out are that whether it is through
  our own piety or ingenuity, the power to save the world ultimately lies in our
  hands.

  Now, if you’ll excuse me I’m going to go and re-watch Bad Boys part one and
  two and look for allegories to Cain and Abel.
  Love, Will

  P.S. Michael Bay also donated all of his Bar Mitzvah money to an animal
  shelter. True story. You can Wikipedia it.
