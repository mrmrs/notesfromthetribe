				  <p>I have little to no authority to speak on behalf of Jews with Jewish tattoos.<br />
Or Jews with non Jewish tattoos. <br />
Or non Jews with tattoos. <br />
Really on any kind of body art whatsoever.<br />
Primarily because I don&#8217;t have any.<br />
However this makes me quite the authority on not having tattoos.<br />
In fact I&#8217;ve not had them my entire life.<br />
I&#8217;m not against them. <br />
Not even remotely.<br />
As an artist I find them to be beautiful (all fairies and barbed wire aside), outward expressions of inward beliefs.<br />
Have I ever wanted one? Only every single time I see some someone with a gorgeous piece running down some exposed piece of flesh.<br />
It is in these same moments that I realize I will never get one.<br />
So why?<br />
Maybe its the Jewish guilt thing? I mean yes, I am very attached to Mother&#8217;s opinion but that hasn&#8217;t stopped me from indulging in serious non Jewish romances, skipping high holiday services and eating the occasional BLT.<br />
So maybe its the permanence of thing. <br />
People seem to always make the argument….what about when you&#8217;re old? Aren&#8217;t you going to look weird as an elderly person with a tattoo? Which I suppose is a valid point from the perspective of a young person. But frankly IF I&#8217;m lucky enough to become a ripe, old, bald, liver spotted, denture wearing old man with a walker, I&#8217;d imagine that having a tattoo will be a minor aesthetic concern.<br />
I think what it comes down to is that I have some serious commitment issues.<br />
A tattoo, by its nature is the act of surrendering to a specific moment, to not caring about how you&#8217;ll feel in the future…but also an awareness that this will last forever.<br />
As somebody whose hairstyle can&#8217;t even seem to commit to one era let alone genre of music I think I&#8217;m just not cut out for it.<br />
So for now, its either drawing on my arm with a sharpie or those temporary ones you get for a quarter at the drugstore.<br />
Not quite as cool, but then it also rubs off with a little water.
