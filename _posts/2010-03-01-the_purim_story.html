  All suspected anti-Semitism aside, it’s shocking that Disney has yet to
  tap into the Jewish market. It seems as though the story of Purim is
  just ripe for an animated musical feature. Here you have Esther, an orphan
  turned Queen who, with the help of her good natured cousin (uncle?
  husband!?!?!)Mordechai,foils the plot of the King’s evil vizier,
  Haman, to destroy the Jewish people. It practically writes itself. True
  to formula, Esther would be a Jasmine/Ariel/Mulan hybrid, an atypical heroine
  who after getting wrapped up in royal life realizes that she must remember
  where she comes from and who she is in order to save her people. Mordechai
  would be sort of a Jiminy Cricket meets Genie type, the lovable moral compass
  of the story. Haman is of course Scar/Jafar/Frollo/ Every other Disney
  Villain, but this time with a pointy three-cornered hat. Naturally,
  being Disney, the story would have to be slightly bastardized. King
  Achashverosh could be played more as a bumbling idiot than a morally
  ambiguous womanizer. There would also have to be some sort of magical
  sidekick for comedic relief, as well as a handsome Persian soldier love
  interest. And in the end, rather than a giant melee in Shushan, the
  story would conclude with the king ordering that all the Jews be saved.
  Sprinkle in some show stopping tunes (by artists like Michael Bolton and
  Elton John) with titles like “Hey Man, Haman, Whaddya Say
  Man?”,“Mordechai, What A Guy!”, and “Esther, This
  Will Surely Test Her”, and you’ve got a surefire blockbuster on
  your hands. Apart from the box office success, the amount of Mickey Mouse
  shaped hamantashen and groggers alone makes this a viable property. There
  could even be a parade in Disneyland right around Purim where all the park
  characters masquerade in costumes while Goofy, dressed as Haman, is hung or
  burned in effigy. Oh well, maybe Robert Iger just isn’t ready,
  maybe the success of ‘An American Tail’
  wasn’t enough to prove that a Jewish story can be an animated feature,
  or maybe those crazy rumors about Walt in the 1940’s are true. Who
  knows?
