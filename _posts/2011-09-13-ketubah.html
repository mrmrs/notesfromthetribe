				  <p>When I was seventh grade, I desperately wanted to marry the girl in my Hebrew School class who sat across from me and will remain nameless for the duration of this post.<br />
Not date.<br />
Marry.<br />
I wanted to be her husband.<br />
I wanted her to be my wife.<br />
I imagined what our children would look like.<br />
I was 11.<br />
Though this girl and I had never talked, we shared a slow dance earlier that school year to Richard Marx&#8217;s &#8216;Right Here Waiting.&#8217;&nbsp;  It was a profound four minutes and twenty three seconds  during the course of which I fell deeply in love.<br />
Often I daydreamed of sending a large bouquet of flowers to her desk in the middle of class.<br />
I fantasized that upon receiving such a generous gift, she&#8217;d look for a card only to find one with the words &#8216;Will you marry me?&#8217; scrawled across without a signature.&nbsp; Confused, she&#8217;d look around the room until finally we&#8217;d lock eyes and she would know.<br />
I saw Christian Slater do it once in &#8216;Bed Of Roses.&#8217; *<br />
I was a pre-teen with bad skin who slept on the bottom bunk. <br />
I hardly knew this person or myself.&nbsp; <br />
But I was ready. <br />
Now I&#8217;m 27.<br />
I have a job, a savings and my own roof over my head.<br />
I&#8217;ve had a string of long, monogamous relationships full of self discoveries and adult problems.<br />
The possibility of marriage is a very real one.<br />
Yet nothing scares me more.<br />
I see my friends making lifelong commitments to cherish, honor, provide for and stand by their spouses.<br />
For whatever reason I just can&#8217;t see myself being able to give that to somebody.<br />
It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t believe in the institution, on the contrary I think its beautiful.<br />
Maybe its me.<br />
Maybe I haven&#8217;t found the right person.<br />
I know this:<br />
Whatever it takes,<br />
or how my heart breaks,<br />
I&#8217;ll be right here,<br />
waiting.</p>

<p>*I had a serious thing for Christian Slater movies.&nbsp; I guess at that age I didn&#8217;t see anything odd about looking to a 36 year old leading man as a role model.&nbsp; Some people had Kurt Cobain.&nbsp; I had Christian. Perhaps it was because as a Jew it was the furthest thing from me. I would even roll the sleeves on my flannels up and slick back my hair to look like him.
