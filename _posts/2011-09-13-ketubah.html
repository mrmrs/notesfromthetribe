<p>
  When I was seventh grade, I desperately wanted to marry the girl in my Hebrew School class who sat across from me and will remain nameless for the duration of this post. <br />
  Not date. <br />
  Marry. <br />
  I wanted to be her husband. <br />
  I wanted her to be my wife. <br />
  I imagined what our children would look like. <br />
  I was 11. <br />
  Though this girl and I had never talked, we shared a slow dance earlier that school year to Richard Marx’s ‘Right Here Waiting. ’ It was a profound four minutes and twenty three seconds  during the course of which I fell deeply in love. <br />
  Often I daydreamed of sending a large bouquet of flowers to her desk in the middle of class. <br />
  I fantasized that upon receiving such a generous gift, she’d look for a card only to find one with the words ‘Will you marry me?’ scrawled across without a signature. Confused, she’d look around the room until finally we’d lock eyes and she would know. <br />
  I saw Christian Slater do it once in ‘Bed Of Roses. ’ *<br />
  I was a pre-teen with bad skin who slept on the bottom bunk. <br />
  I hardly knew this person or myself. <br />
  But I was ready. <br />
  Now I’m 27. <br />
  I have a job, a savings and my own roof over my head. <br />
  I’ve had a string of long, monogamous relationships full of self discoveries and adult problems. <br />
  The possibility of marriage is a very real one. <br />
  Yet nothing scares me more. <br />
  I see my friends making lifelong commitments to cherish, honor, provide for and stand by their spouses. <br />
  For whatever reason I just can’t see myself being able to give that to somebody. <br />
  It’s not that I don’t believe in the institution, on the contrary I think its beautiful. <br />
  Maybe its me. <br />
  Maybe I haven’t found the right person. <br />
  I know this:<br />
  Whatever it takes,<br />
  or how my heart breaks,<br />
  I’ll be right here,<br />
  waiting. </p>

<p>P. S. On the subject of a Ketubahs, check out <a href="http://www.Ketuv.com">http://www.Ketuv.com</a> ! The’ve got great fine art ketubahs including one I’ve designed very shortly!</p>

<p>*I had a serious thing for Christian Slater movies. I guess at that age I didn’t see anything odd about looking to a 36 year old leading man as a role model. Some people had Kurt Cobain. I had Christian. Perhaps it was because as a Jew it was the furthest thing from me. I would even roll the sleeves on my flannels up and slick back my hair to look like him.
