<p>
  I could have been the coolest kid in my yeshiva. Instead, I was not the
  coolest kid at Laguna Hills High School. Not that I was a social pariah
  either. I was very middle of the road cool. The kind of cool that
  gets you a couple candid shots in the yearbook with friends, but not nearly
  enough to ensure you a full two page spread of just your face at a dance. To
  illustrate, I have created the following scale of coolness:
</p>
<p>
  tube
  socks—————me—————————————————space
  travel
</p>
<p>
 As you can see by my brilliant illustration, I was a little cooler than the
 dependability and comfort of tube socks, but a far cry from the awesomeness
 and wonder of space travel. But, if I had gone to a yeshiva it would
 have been a different story. As I see it, the following were the limiting
 factors that contributed to my popularity level and why attending a religious
 school would have changed it all: 1) Sports— never have I ever heard of
 anyone getting a scholarship to play for a yeshiva basketball team, nor have I
 heard of a NBA player that came out of a yeshiva, for that matter. I
 can’t imagine that yeshiva students spend their Saturdays covering themselves
 in body paint to cheer against their rivals. I’m not saying it
 doesn’t happen, it might. In fact, I’m sure that people play
 sports and are sports fans at yeshiva, but the primary function of a yeshiva
 is to learn Judaic texts. I’m sure I would have had a far easier time
 doing that than attempting to ride the bench all season. 2 ) Money— the
 students who went to my high school were faced with two hard decisions growing
 up: Mercedes or BMW. I drove a ’92 Buick Skylark I called ‘white
 lightening’ because it had a giant scrape in the hood that looked like a
 thunderbolt. At a yeshiva, the only accessories I would have needed to worry
 about would’ve been my tzit tzit and my yarmulke. 3)Girls— perhaps,
 owing to what I lack in the two aforementioned categories; I did not have my
 pick of the litter, so to speak. And women, or at least one’s ability to
 court them, are a social currency in high school. Many yeshivas are not co-ed,
 and even in cases in which they are, the focus is on study, not
 socializing. Problem solved. Granted, a lot of my conclusions are based
 on the bold generalization that a yeshiva is an orthodox Jewish institution of
 learning. In truth, there are many different types of yeshivas, in all
 denominations, that cater to all types of Jews. And of course, no matter what
 social group one joins, there will always be superficial criterion with which
 to judge people. In an overarching sense, however, they are places of rigorous
 religious academics that value debate and intellect over material goods and
 outward appearances. In this element (with a little Torah and the Talmud) I
 would have flourished. I don’t mean to toot my own horn…but, beep
 beep.
