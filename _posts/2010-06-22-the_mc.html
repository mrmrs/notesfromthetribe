  Any given Saturday night, somebody, somewhere, is dancing to the B-52’s
  ‘Love Shack’.
</p>
<p>
  They are wearing some combination of plastic fedora hat, glowsticks, novelty
  sunglasses, mardi gras beads, and playing an inflatable instrument.
</p>
<p>
  When the song reaches it’s climax at the bridge, this person will ball
  up both their hands into fists and pump them into the air chanting
  “BANG BANG ON THE DOOR BABY!” So will everyone else around
  them.
</p>
<p>
  This is no accident. It isn’t a coincidence. These things don’t
  just happen.
</p>
<p>
  He makes it happen. <br />
  Not a Rabbi.<br />
  Not a Cantor.<br />
  But just as important to the success of your simcha.<br />
  The MC.
