				  <p>ATTENTION MEMBERS OF THE TRIBE: THIS WEEK I WILL BE CELEBRATING THE WONDERFUL SIMCHA THAT IS MY BEST FRIEND&#8217;S WEDDING IN NEW YORK, CONSEQUENTLY, ORDERS THAT ARE PLACED THIS WEEK, WILL SHIP MONDAY THE 22.</p>

<p>We now return our regularly scheduled programming:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve added a fifth question to the seder this year:</p>

<p>Why is it that in any other form, this matzoh we eat is the bread of affliction which our forefathers ate when the holy one, blessed be he brought us forth with an outstretched arm from bondage in the land of egypt.&nbsp; But, when combined with salt, schmaltz, and chicken broth, becomes a delicious comfort food served by Jewish bubbys year round?
