  Sarah, once sterile, was so elated to hear that she was going to have a child
  that her laughter has become legendary.
</p>
<p>
  Indeed, at the age of 90 she became the world’s first Jewish Mother.
</p>
<p>
  This is only speculation, but I can’t help thinking she maybe partly
  responsible for all the wonderful, worried, overly involved archetypal women
  doting over their sons today.
</p>
<p>
  I mean come on, she banished Ishmael and his Mom into the cold wilderness when
  she heard Isaac was being made fun of.
</p>
<p>
  Not to mention that her death is thought to be the result of hearing that her
  son had been sacrificed by Abraham.
</p>
<p>
  It’s just as well, if she’d seen the mishagas that went on with her
  grandchildren she’d have probably died from a heart attack anyway.
</p>
<p>
  If it is true, if she had anything to do with the woman who raised me, I’d
  like to use this weeks post to say:
</p>
<p>
  Thanks, Sarah.
