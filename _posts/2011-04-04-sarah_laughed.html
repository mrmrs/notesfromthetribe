				  <p>Sarah, once sterile, was so elated to hear that she was going to have a child that her laughter has become legendary.</p>

<p>Indeed, at the age of 90 she became the world&#8217;s first Jewish Mother.</p>

<p>This is only speculation, but I can&#8217;t help thinking she maybe partly responsible for all the wonderful, worried, overly involved archetypal women doting over their sons today.</p>

<p>I mean come on, she banished Ishmael and his Mom into the cold wilderness when she heard Isaac was being made fun of.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Not to mention that her death is thought to be the result of hearing that her son had been sacrificed by Abraham.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s just as well, if she&#8217;d seen the mishagas that went on with her grandchildren she&#8217;d have probably died from a heart attack anyway.</p>

<p>If it is true, if she had anything to do with the woman who raised me, I&#8217;d like to use this weeks post to say:</p>

<p>Thanks, Sarah.
