  I've heard Purim referred to as &#8216;The Jewish Mardi Gras'.
</p>
<p>
  This is an understandable oversight.
</p>
<p>
  Granted, both are celebrations that involve masquerade, carnivals, beauty
  pageants, the baking of special pastries,inebriation, and all around general
  reverie.
</p>
<p>
  That said, I have never once a seen a drunken woman remove her top in
  exchange for some plastic beads during a reading of the Megillah.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe I'm going to the wrong synagogues.
