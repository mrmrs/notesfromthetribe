<p>
  This is for all my Jews out there that don’t observe Shabbat. <br />
  Try this. <br />
</p>
<p>
  Next Saturday, once you’ve awoke around noon either well rested from your
  morning in or hungover from your night out walk to your nearest orthodox
  synagogue… and listen.
</p>
<p>
  Do you hear the jangling of keys? <br />
  Look around. <br />
  Do you see somebody possibly pushing a stroller? <br />
  Take a look up near the power lines. <br />
  Look closer. <br />
  Do you see a small piece of fishing line?Maybe a thin white string?<br />
  If so, you maybe standing dead center in the middle of an eruv. <br />
  Consider what this means. <br />

  An eruv is a specially demarcated enclosure created so that Torah observant Jews can carry objects on the Sabbath. This must be created for things as simple as carrying a tissue in one’s pocket. <br />
  Take a second to appreciate just how much work goes into not doing work. <br />
  Do you remember the last time your power went out?<br />
  How about the last time your car broke down?<br />
  Or that you lost your wallet?<br />
  Great. <br />
  Now imagine all three happening every week from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday and that depending on where you are, you occasionally lose the ability to do things like bring food to your mouth. <br />
  Oh and you also have to prepare a few large meals and go to services. <br />
  Now that, is commitment.
