  I would argue that Jews kiss things more than any other religion on the
  planet.While not a direct mandate, kissing is a way of showing
  reverence and we do it to all sort of things.
</p>

<p class="lh-copy measure">
  Prayer books.<br />
  Mezuzahs.<br />
  Tallitot.<br />
  Tzit tzit.<br />
  Tefillin.<br />
  Torah mantles.<br />
  Torah scrolls.<br />
  Paroches.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  Also if you go to Jewish summer camp there’s a fair amount of it going on.<br />
  Oh, and don’t forget your mother.
