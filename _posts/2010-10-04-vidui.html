  In the spirit of the New Year I’d like to begin this post by
  apologizing for not posting something in quite some time. I assure you
  I’ve been very busy and in fact this post was on the cover of the High
  Holidays issue of The Jewish Journal (Thank You so much to Rob Eshman). &
  Check it out here: you can

  I have a small confession to make: Yom Kippur is my absolute favorite Holiday. &
  Maybe it’s wrong to say, but I relish the combination of a 25 hour fast,
  intensive introspection and meditative prayer. My mother can attest to this. I
  have a special pair of pants I wear once a year that I keep cleaned an pressed
  at her house just for the occasion. For me the appeal is the release. Kind of
  the same way one might look forward to a triathlon for the feeling they get
  after throwing up and collapsing. I throw on my white t-shirt, turn off my
  lights, and take a good hard look inside. In any situation in my life there
  are two contributing factors: me and something else. Through many a humbling
  lesson I’ve learned not to concern myself with the latter. And so it is
  that every Yom Kippur after I think of all the people I’ve wronged, and
  all people that have wronged me, the one I find nearly impossible to forgive is
  myself. The Vidui allows me to openly admit my shortcomings, and then gives me
  permission to let them go. Both physically and spiritually there is never a
  time I feel lighter than after the book of life is closed. Then I go stuff my
  face, and stock up for next year.
