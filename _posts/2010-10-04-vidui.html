				  <p>&nbsp;  &nbsp; In the spirit of the New Year I&#8217;d like to begin this post by apologizing for not posting something in quite some time.&nbsp; I assure you I&#8217;ve been very busy and in fact this post was on the cover of the High Holidays issue of The Jewish Journal (Thank You so much to Rob Eshman).&nbsp; Check it out here: you can check it out here &nbsp;  <a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/cover_story/article/true_paths_to_destination_requires_a_journey_of_actions_not_just_words_2010/">http://www.jewishjournal.com/cover_story/article/true_paths_to_destination_requires_a_journey_of_actions_not_just_words_2010/</a><br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp; I have a small confession to make: Yom Kippur is my absolute favorite Holiday.&nbsp; Maybe it&#8217;s wrong to say, but I relish the combination of a 25 hour fast, intensive introspection and meditative prayer.&nbsp; My mother can attest to this. I have a special pair of pants I wear once a year that I keep cleaned an pressed at her house just for the occasion.&nbsp; For me the appeal is the release.&nbsp; Kind of the same way one might look forward to a triathlon for the feeling they get after throwing up and collapsing.&nbsp; I throw on my white t-shirt, turn off my lights, and take a good hard look inside.&nbsp; In any situation in my life there are two contributing factors: me and something else. Through many a humbling lesson I&#8217;ve learned not to concern myself with the latter. And so it is that every Yom Kippur after I think of all the people I&#8217;ve wronged, and all people that have wronged me, the one I find nearly impossible to forgive is myself. The Vidui allows me to openly admit my shortcomings, and then gives me permission to let them go.&nbsp; Both physically and spiritually there is never a time I feel lighter than after the book of life is closed. Then I go stuff my face, and stock up for next year.
