<p class="lh-copy measure">
  I recently watched an illuminating interview with religious scholar and author
  Joanna Brooks on the Daily Show With Jon Stewart.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure">
  In it she describes her upbringing in a traditional Mormon household. She
  remarks that her religion was founded on a 14 year old boy going out into a
  grove of trees to ask hard questions and so she too ‘was taught to ask hard
  questions’ ever since she was a little girl. She goes on to say ‘I felt like
  that is what I should do. Life was meaningful, I should seek out meaning.’
</p>
  I was on board.<br />
  Here was a mormon talking to a Jew on television and describing my exact life philosophy.<br />
  Who would’ve thought? We’re not so different after all.<br />
  And then she wrapped up her thoughts with the following statement: ‘There were answers. It was a beautiful, comforting, warm way to grow up.’<br />
  And then she totally lost me.<br />
  Answers?<br />
  Her religion had answers?!?!?!!<br />
  And just so I’m clear here…those answers were COMFORTING AND WARM???<br />
  I was incensed.<br />
  I was jealous.<br />
  As a Jew all I have are questions. And in the rare event of answer I’m usually left questioning it.<br />
  Far from comforting.<br />
  I’ve been at this for 30 years and I still don’t know what God (if he/she/it even exists) looks like.<br />
  I have no idea where I’m going when I die.<br />
  And much as I can rationalize some reasons for doing so, I don’t ultimately know exactly why I fast once year for my sins other than that its written that I should. <br />
  But Judaism is not a religion of comfort.<br />
  It is a religion of commandments.<br />
  We don’t follow them for pleasure or for praise.<br />
  We do them because we’re told to choose life and pursue justice.<br />
  It is a test.<br />
  A test comprised of unanswerable questions.<br />
  Therein lies the beauty of Judaism.<br />
  It  embraces ambiguity.<br />
  It sees a fundamental truth in nothingness.<br />
  It recognizes that we are desert wanderers seeking exodus, trying desperately to make sense of things that will never make any.<br />
  And in doing so, it destroys all those false idols that would try to convince us of anything else.
