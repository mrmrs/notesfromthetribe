				  <p>I recently watched an illuminating interview with religious scholar and author Joanna Brooks on the Daily Show With Jon Stewart. <br />
In it she describes her upbringing in a traditional Mormon household. She remarks that her religion was founded on a 14 year old boy going out into a grove of trees to ask hard questions and so she too &#8216;was taught to ask hard questions&#8217; ever since she was a little girl.&nbsp;  She goes on to say &#8216;I felt like that is what I should do. Life was meaningful, I should seek out meaning.&#8217;<br />
I was on board.<br />
Here was a mormon talking to a Jew on television and describing my exact life philosophy.<br />
Who would&#8217;ve thought? We&#8217;re not so different after all.<br />
And then she wrapped up her thoughts with the following statement: &#8216;There were answers. It was a beautiful, comforting, warm way to grow up.&#8217;<br />
And then she totally lost me.<br />
Answers?<br />
Her religion had answers?!?!?!!<br />
And just so I&#8217;m clear hereâ€¦those answers were COMFORTING AND WARM???<br />
I was incensed.<br />
I was jealous.<br />
As a Jew all I have are questions. And in the rare event of answer I&#8217;m usually left questioning it.<br />
Far from comforting.<br />
I&#8217;ve been at this for 30 years and I still don&#8217;t know what God (if he/she/it even exists) looks like.<br />
I have no idea where I&#8217;m going when I die.<br />
And much as I can rationalize some reasons for doing so, I don&#8217;t ultimately know exactly why I fast once year for my sins other than that its written that I should. <br />
But Judaism is not a religion of comfort.<br />
It is a religion of commandments.<br />
We don&#8217;t follow them for pleasure or for praise.<br />
We do them because we&#8217;re told to choose life and pursue justice.<br />
It is a test.<br />
A test comprised of unanswerable questions.<br />
Therein lies the beauty of Judaism.<br />
It  embraces ambiguity.<br />
It sees a fundamental truth in nothingness.<br />
It recognizes that we are desert wanderers seeking exodus, trying desperately to make sense of things that will never make any.<br />
And in doing so, it destroys all those false idols that would try to convince us of anything else.
