  Perhaps Rap’s biggest contribution to the spoken word was the phonic
  device ‘ah’. This tool made it possible to rhyme words that end
  in -er with words that end in  -ou and occasionally could be used to create
  entirely new words. For example in Jay-Z’s 1998 single ‘Can I Get
  A…’ he speaks the following words:<br />
  “Do you need a ball-ah<br />
  To go shopping at the mall-ah<br />
  Brag, tell your friends what I bought y-ah”
</p>
<p>
  Brilliantly, three dissimilar words are brought together by one sound.
  Unfortunately, I am not rapper. As this is the case I found it very hard to
  rhyme anything with ‘Challah’, save for one word in the second to
  last line of the following sonnet I wrote:
</p>
<p>
  Oh delicious loaves of braided bread<br />
  Both are uncovered on Friday night as a group<br />
  And are quickly torn apart instead <br />
  To be used as mops for sauce and soup<br />
  Come Saturday morning there is only one loaf left<br />
  It will get exactly what it deserves<br />
  So into slices it is cleft <br />
  and covered with butter and preserves<br />
  After all of this, should any remain<br />
  Remember to keep it in boxes or bags with covers<br />
  By all means do not refrain<br />
  From using it to make sandwiches with leftovers. <br />
  Whether you enjoy Kabbalat Shabbat, the torah service or Havdallah<br />
  Come the weekend, it’s hard to argue with a good ol’ piece of Challah.
</p>
