  Abercrombie and Fitch.<br />
  Never has a clothing company sold so much whilst wearing so little.<br />
  While most commonly associated with shirtless, sandy haired, blue eyed goyim
  beefcakes, this Jewish founded company has influenced Jewish culture in two
  very specific and perhaps overlooked (or over shadowed by incredibly sexy
  naked young people) ways:
</p>

<p>
  1.If you were anybody in the adolescent world of USY and Jewish Summer Camp/
  Israel programs between 1998 and 2001…you were wearing Abercrombie and
  Fitch.All the cool kids had it. So did I.Whether you were wearing a baseball
  cap, a visor, a flannel, a henley top, a bungee corded pair of cargo pants or
  a jersey it was essential that all your apparel had the appearance of being
  thoroughly worn to the point of stylish tearing.Indeed if one were to only
  look at the youth of this time period, it would appear that Jews excelled
  solely in the areas of Field Hockey, Rugby and Rowing.
</p>

<p>
  2.If you are an old Jewish lady in America, chances are you have, or know
  someone who has played mahjong. Originally developed in China, the game was
  introduced to the U.S. when Ezra Fitch, of A and F fame sent emissaries to
  villages in the east to buy up every mahjong set they could find.Over 12,000
  were sold in 1920 alone. Jewish women popularized the game with the creation
  of The National MahJong League throughout World War Two.Apparently we have
  more in common than just the food we eat on December 25th.
</p>

<p>
  Who knows, maybe one day A and F will return to its Jewish roots and start
  advertising with pale waifish intellectuals and old ladies playing tile
  matching games. And on that day you’ll find me standing outside their retail
  store at the Grove… shirtless.
