				  <p>Abercrombie and Fitch.<br />
Never has a clothing company sold so much whilst wearing so little.<br />
While most commonly associated with shirtless, sandy haired, blue eyed goyim beefcakes, this Jewish founded company has influenced Jewish culture in two very specific and perhaps overlooked (or over shadowed by incredibly sexy naked young people) ways: </p>

<p>1.If you were anybody in the adolescent world of USY and Jewish Summer Camp/ Israel programs between 1998 and 2001…you were wearing Abercrombie and Fitch.&nbsp; All the cool kids had it. So did I.&nbsp; Whether you were wearing a baseball cap, a visor, a flannel, a henley top, a bungee corded pair of cargo pants or a jersey it was essential that all your apparel had the appearance of being thoroughly worn to the point of stylish tearing.&nbsp; Indeed if one were to only look at the youth of this time period, it would appear that Jews excelled solely in the areas of Field Hockey, Rugby and Rowing.</p>

<p>2.If you are an old Jewish lady in America, chances are you have, or know someone who has played mahjong. Originally developed in China, the game was introduced to the U.S. when Ezra Fitch, of A and F fame sent emissaries to villages in the east to buy up every mahjong set they could find.&nbsp; Over 12,000 were sold in 1920 alone. Jewish women popularized the game with the creation of The National MahJong League throughout World War Two.&nbsp; Apparently we have more in common than just the food we eat on December 25th.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe one day A and F will return to its Jewish roots and start advertising with pale waifish intellectuals and old ladies playing tile matching games. And on that day you&#8217;ll find me standing outside their retail store at the Grove….shirtless.&nbsp;
