				  <p>Jews love the Torah the way my nephew loved The Lion King when he was 3.<br />
Specifically: A lot.<br />
On a typical day he would readily consume up to seven viewings of the  film.<br />
With a run time of 87 minutes that&#8217;s nearly 10 and a half hours. <br />
Considering that the average 3 year old sleeps 10-12 hours and that meals were about forty minutes a piece, its safe to say that on any given day I watched him, nearly every waking minute not spent eating, bathing or defecating was used enjoying this movie.<br />
The most amazing part of it all was how he never tired of it. <br />
On the contrary, as soon as the credits rolled he demanded that it start all over again.<br />
Being his babysitter, this of course can become draining after the first 2 viewings. And so my sister and I tried to pique his interests in the bevy of other options from the Disney library. <br />
Nothing.<br />
We tried board games, picking him up and spinning him around, bribing him with candy.<br />
No Dice. <br />
This kid wanted Hakuna Matata and he wanted it now.<br />
On repeat.<br />
For the next six hours.<br />
It seemed that as he sang along with each musical number that there was a familiarity he craved, but also a miraculous ability to find every joke and dramatic turn just as fresh as the first time he saw it.<br />
Similarly each year we finish reading the Torah and immediately go back to the beginning and rejoice in its repetition.<br />
We know the songs, we know the plot lines, it is familiar and it is new.<br />
Of course my nephew is now long past this ageâ€¦but his little brother isn&#8217;t.</p>
