<p>
  Corned beef, pastrami, turkey pastrami, liver, salami, hard salami, bologna,
  goulash, tongue, schnitzel, roast turkey, smoked turkey, roast beef, and
  brisket.
</p>

<p>
  The list makes my mouth water.
</p>
<p>
  In fact living in Orange County we would drive up two hours to Los Angeles
  just to get my usual: Pastrami on Sourdough with a side of ketchup (I
  knowâ€¦ketchup).
</p>
<p>
  Kosher meat the way it was meant to be.
</p>
<p>
  Stacked higher than your jaw can unhinge.
</p>
<p>
  Where bread is a formality and the only veggies you need are the cole slaw and
  pickles.
</p>

<p>
  Wash it down with a prescription from my favorite Jewish doctor: Browns.
</p>
<p>
  Delish.
