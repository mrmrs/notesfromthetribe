<p>
  My preschool teacher was concerned that I had developmental disabilities.<br />
  So concerned in fact that she called my Mother into the school to discuss it.<br />
  My Mother thanked her and asked what behavior I was displaying that would denote any sort of issue.<br />
  At this point my teacher filled up a pitcher with water, gave me a cup and asked me to pour.<br />
  I spilled the contents everywhere.<br />
  ‘Use your left hand William’ my Mother said.
</p>
<p>Problem solved.</p>
<p>
  It hasn’t been easy growing up as a southpaw in a right handed world.<br />
  The worst was learning to cut paper.<br />
  Thats when they really separate the righties from the lefties.<br />
  While everybody else got beautifully pointed, stainless steel blades with
  bright red handles I was forced to make do with the rounded off, puke green
  shears left rusting in an old Yuban coffee can branded with a giant ‘L’.
</p>
<p>
  Naturally, this was par for the course.<br />
  Right handed desks.<br />
  Right handed baseball mitts.<br />
  Right handed guitars and can openers.<br />
  Even the cords on credit card machines are on the right hand side so you have
  to stretch them awkwardly at an angle just to sign with your left hand.
  <br />
  I’m reminded that about 90 percent of the world is right handed every time I go to shake somebody’s hand.<br />
  But by and far the bane of my existence has been the fact that I cannot write
  more than a sentence without completely smudging the writing and discoloring
  the side of my palm as I drag it across the paper from left to right.
  <br />
  And to top it off studies show that my lifespan is almost a decade shorter than the rest of you.
</p>

<p>
  On the other hand (pun so very much intended) if I were a more pious man, its
  for this very reason that I’d probably make an excellent sofer.
