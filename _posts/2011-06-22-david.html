				  <p>I'm fairly confident I could successfully guide King David's music career.</p>

<p>Now, I know what you're thinking. In today's synthesized, super-sexualized, overhyped music industry is there really a place for spiritual harp music? </p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p>The key is volume. The entire Beatles catalogue has 275 original compositions. <br />
David wrote 3600.The man is a machine.The licensing alone would be more than enough.He's also got a niche with religious music.Oh yeah and I forgot to mention his biggest fan….God.</p>

<p>I'm thinking we market him as &#8216;Kenny G meets John Mayer….with a harp.'</p>

<p>I've even got a name for his first album: &#8216;Yaweh or the Highway'.</p>
