  I’m fairly confident I could successfully guide King David’s music career.
</p>
<p>
  Now, I know what you’re thinking. In today’s synthesized, super-sexualized,
  overhyped music industry is there really a place for spiritual harp music?
</p>
<p>
  Yes.
</p>
<p>
  The key is volume. The entire Beatles catalogue has 275 original compositions.
  <br />
  David wrote 3600. The man is a machine. The licensing alone would be more than
  enough. He’s also got a niche with religious music. Oh yeah and I forgot to
  mention his biggest fan…. God.
</p>
<p>
  I’m thinking we market him as ‘Kenny G meets John Mayer…. with a harp. ’
</p>
<p>
  I’ve even got a name for his first album: ‘Yaweh or the Highway’.
</p>
<p>
  Edgy.
