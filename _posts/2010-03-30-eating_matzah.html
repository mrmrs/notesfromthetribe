<p>It's lunchtime.</p>
<p>Matzah, gefilte fish, and leben.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>Immediately you feel a pair of eyes.</p>
<p>Between bites of his footlong turkey on jalapeno cheddar, your co worker inquires:</p>
<p>
  &#8216;What is that?'<br />
  &#8216;It's fish….sort of….'<br />
  &#8216;No! No! that white cracker thing….'<br />
  You break off a small piece without hesitation and hand it over.<br />
  He chews it slowly.<br />
  He lights up.<br />
  &#8216;Hey! That stuff isn't bad!!!'<br />
  Try eating it for eight days, you think.<br />
  Then talk to me.
