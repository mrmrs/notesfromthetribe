<p>
  If life gives you lemons, first make sure they’re not etrogs.
</p>
<p>
  This can be confusing as an etrog with it’s bumpy rind looks like a lemon that
  has been sitting in the bathtub for too long. But if what you have is indeed
  an etrog, grab the nearest lulav and shake the two in all four directions.
</p>
<p>
  Otherwise make lemonade.
